With that, Albino strode purposefully toward the exit, his senses on high alert as he prepared to make his escape. As his blood began to boil with the adrenaline of impending danger, he knew he had to move quickly; his time in the elevated state was limited, and he couldn't afford to linger.

As he raced down the dimly lit corridors, the sound of approaching footsteps echoed from thirty feet behind him. With a grim determination, Albino braced himself for the inevitable confrontation. Suddenly, a barrage of gunfire erupted from the other end of the hallway as more guards appeared, their miniguns blazing with deadly intent.

Albino's instincts kicked into overdrive as he ducked and weaved, his movements fluid and precise as he evaded the hail of bullets. With lightning speed, he returned fire with his own Gatling gun, his aim deadly accurate as he picked off his attackers one by one, even as they scrambled and attempted to run for cover.

The corridor became a battleground, the air thick with the acrid stench of gunpowder and the metallic tang of blood. Despite the overwhelming odds against him, Albino pressed forward, his resolve unshakable as he fought tooth and nail to ensure his escape.
