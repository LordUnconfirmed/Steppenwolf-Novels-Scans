With a fluidity that belies the intensity of the moment, Albino counters the beast's aggression with a maneuver as unexpected as it is effective. He engages the creature with a suplex, a move that showcases not just his skill but the sheer physical strength he now wields. The action of flipping the beast over and onto the ground is executed with a precision that speaks volumes of Albino's expertise and the heightened abilities granted by the serum.
As the beast finds itself momentarily vulnerable, Albino shifts tactics, attempting a maneuver uncharacteristic of traditional martial arts. He wraps his arms around the creature in a bear hug, a move born of his newfound power rather than technique. His muscles, imbued with extraordinary strength, tighten with the intent to crush, to impose upon the beast a physical dominance that mirrors their shifting dynamic.
The beast, caught in the grip of Albino's enhanced strength, reacts with a wild desperation. Its limbs flail, claws swiping in a frenzied attempt to escape the crushing embrace that threatens to compress bone and sinew. The sounds of its bones beginning to give under the pressure, great enough to crush a slab of rebar into fine powder, popping with the stress of the assault, fill the air, a gruesome melody to their deadly dance.
Yet, the beast is not without resources. In a move driven by instinct and the raw will to survive, it manages to land a headbutt with enough force to momentarily stun Albino, leveraging this brief advantage to wriggle free from his grasp.
