The confrontation escalates as Albino and the beast, driven by primal instincts and newfound powers, hurtle towards each other with a ferocity that fills the air with electric anticipation. The beast, its every muscle coiled and ready to unleash devastation, swipes at Albino with a force that could most assuredly exceed the destructive charge of a 40-ton truck hurtling at full speed. The air itself seems to split under the sheer power of its attack, a testament to the lethal capability housed within its formidable frame.
Albino, however, is no longer the man who once might have faltered under such a blow. The serum's influence courses through him, rendering his body a paragon of resilience. The swipe, though it carries enough force to decimate any ordinary opponent, only succeeds in momentarily disorienting himâ€”a testament to his enhanced condition. It's a disorientation that lasts but a fraction of a second, yet within that sliver of time, Albino's training as a martial artist asserts itself.
