The memory of the discomfort and pain from the electrical shock, though minor compared to the physical onslaught they were both enduring, sparks a realization in him. The unpleasant sensation, the brief but acute vulnerability he felt when the current coursed through him, stands out as a significant moment in the blur of their confrontation.

It's this recollection, juxtaposed against the backdrop of their seemingly endless battle, that leads Albino to an epiphany. If the clone shares his physical strengths and weaknesses, then perhaps, just perhaps, it might also share his susceptibility to electricity. Could electrocution, then, be the key to overcoming the clone? The idea takes root in Albino's mind, offering a glimmer of strategic hope amidst the deadlock.

This newfound possibility ignites a spark of tactical planning in Albino. The battle had proven that brute force alone was insufficient to best the clone. But this potential vulnerability, this Achilles heel in their shared physiology, could provide the edge Albino needed to finally tip the scales in his favor. With the room around them a testament to the futility of their continued physical struggle, the concept of using electricity as a weapon against the clone offers a path forward, a way to break the impasse and potentially secure victory.

As Albino stands amidst the wreckage of their fight, his gaze flickers to the exposed wires of the shattered console, a beacon of potential in the storm of their battle. The possibility of electrocution as a means to defeat the clone occupies his thoughts, a strategy forming amidst the chaos. It's a risk, but one that Albino is increasingly convinced he must take. The fight had reached a point where conventional methods were no longer viable; innovation and adaptation were the keys to success.

In a moment of tactical retrospection, Albino's gaze lingers on the remnants of the control panel, its destruction earlier in their fight by the clone now laden with irony. The clone had sought to prevent Albino from using the lights as a weapon against it, yet in doing so, it inadvertently provided him with the inspiration for a new strategy. Amidst the chaos of their ongoing battle, a piece of wooden board, splintered and jagged from the relentless exchange of force, catches Albino's eye—a remnant of their destruction repurposed for survival.
With a newfound resolve, Albino seizes the wooden board, its weight familiar and oddly reassuring in his grasp. He launches into a sprint, his focus laser-sharp on the exposed wires of the dismantled panel, the very heart of his emergent plan. The clone, ever the mirror of Albino's aggression, gives chase, its movements shadowing his with predatory precision. But Albino is a step ahead, his mind orchestrating the steps of a dance only he fully comprehends.

In a calculated move, just as he closes the distance to the panel, Albino feigns a stumble, a deliberate act of deception. His body collapses forward, an orchestrated tumble that sends him sprawling face-first into the ground. The clone, caught off-guard by the sudden fall, hesitates, its momentum carrying it forward but its focus is momentarily disrupted.

This moment of confusion is all Albino needs. With the agility borne of desperation and the clarity of purpose fueling his actions, he springs up from his feigned defeat. In one fluid motion, he captures the clone, his hands finding the back of its head with unerring precision. With a force driven by the urgency of the moment, he thrusts the clone's face into the gaping maw of the exposed panel, where wires spark hungrily, eager for contact.

The wooden board, now instrumental to his plan, is positioned between his hands and the clone's head, insulating him from the electricity while ensuring the clone receives the full brunt of the voltage. Thousands of volts surge through the clone's body, a violent torrent of energy that it cannot escape. The air is filled with the smell of ozone and the sound of electrical crackling, a symphony of destruction that crescendos with the clone's scream—a sound that is both victory and a grim reminder of the lengths to which Albino has had to go.

The clone's body convulses under the relentless assault of the current, its scream piercing the charged air. It's a sound that marks the turning point in their battle, a desperate cry that signifies the effectiveness of Albino's gambit.

As the clone's screams dwindle into silence, Albino waits with bated breath, his eyes fixed on the now motionless form slumped against the damaged console. The once relentless opponent lies still, its face marred by the ordeal, blood trickling from wounds that, notably, show no sign of the rapid healing that had defined their struggle up to this point. It's a critical observation, one that suggests the electrifying assault might have done more than physically incapacitate the clone.

With cautious optimism, Albino retrieves his rifle, the weapon feeling strangely foreign in his hands after the intense, close-quarters combat. He aims at the clone, a part of him still expecting the bullet wound to close, to bear witness once again to the miraculous regenerative abilities the serum had granted them. Yet, as the gun fires and the bullet finds its mark, the anticipated healing does not occur. The wound remains, a stark, unchanging testament to the clone's newfound vulnerability.

This revelation, that electricity could indeed impair their powers, emboldens Albino. It offers not just a means to end the immediate threat but also a sliver of understanding about the limitations of their enhanced physiology
