The brief respite Albino earned by righting the bulldozer was shattered in an instant, the oppressive atmosphere of the outpost barely allowing him a moment to catch his breath. The beast, undeterred by the display of human resilience and seemingly incensed by it, was upon him with a swiftness that bordered on the supernatural. Its predatory focus had not waned; if anything, it had intensified, the creature evidently determined to eliminate any and all threats to its dominion over the facility.
With terrifying agility, the beast turned its attention to one of the deceased guards. In a display of brute strength that defied Albino's understanding of biological limitations, it hurled the guard's limp form towards him with the ease of throwing a rag doll. The guard's body became an unwilling projectile, aimed with deadly precision at Albino.
The impact was jarring, the force of the collision enough to send both Albino and the guard crashing into the foot-thick brick wall behind them. The wall, constructed to withstand the rigors of the outpost's environment, buckled under the unexpected assault. Brick and mortar gave way, testament to the beast's monstrous power, and for a moment, Albino found himself briefly staggering under the weight of the blow.
Albino's resolve, however, remained unbroken. With a grunt, he extricated himself from beneath the guard and the rubble, some fragments of which were so large they must could have measured up to his waistline if stood-up. The guard's body was limp, a lifeless barrier between him and the relentless adversary they faced. As he stood, brushing off the dust and debris, a fleeting thought crossed Albino's mind, a wish for invisibility, for a means to evade the beast's keen senses. The notion was born of desperation, a silent plea for any advantage in the face of such overwhelming odds.
