As the dust began to settle, revealing the aftermath of the chaos, Kane emerged from the swirling cloud, a determined glint in his eyes. His muscles rippled with tension as he sprinted towards Albino, a massive marble column  clutched tightly in his hands. Hoisting several dozen tons seemed to be inconsequential to Kane as he wielded the prodigious javelin like a weapon, his intent clear: to crush his adversary against the unforgiving walls of the warehouse.

Albino's senses were on high alert as he braced himself for the impending collision. With lightning reflexes, he caught the other end of the marble column just as Kane maneuvered his own end, their combined strength turning the massive structure into a deadly instrument of destruction. The air crackled with tension as they wrestled for control, each man fighting with everything he had.

Their clash went on, as Albino found himself slammed against the nearest wall, the unforgiving concrete pressing into his back. The marble column pressed against his midsection like a vice, threatening to crush him with its weight. With a grunt of effort, Albino fought against the overwhelming force, his muscles straining with the effort to free himself from Kane's grip.

With a surge of adrenaline, Albino managed to maneuver himself out from beneath the column, his body protesting with each movement. But there was no time to dwell on the pain as he seized the opportunity to turn the tables on his opponent. With a swift, calculated motion, he wrested the column from Kane's grasp, his fingers tightening around the cold stone with determination.

Then, with a primal roar, Albino swung the marble column like a bat, the air whistling around him as he unleashed its full force upon Kane. The impact was bone-jarring, the sound of shattering glass filling the air as Kane was sent hurtling through the warehouse like a ragdoll. He soared through the air with breathtaking speed, his body crashing into a nearby vehicle with a sickening crunch.

The metal groaned and buckled under the force of Kane's landing, the vehicle collapsing like a tin can beneath his weight.
