Albino, assessing the situation with a tactical eye, sought to take advantage of his position. Crouching out of direct sight, he prepared to engage, the weight of the M16 in his hands a familiar comfort. His intention was clear — to neutralize the perceived threat swiftly, to protect the mission and the secrets it guarded. The guards, unaware of his presence, remained focused on their own unseen adversary.

But the outpost held more than just human foes. The air itself seemed to betray the presence of another, more lethal threat. A sudden, sharp sound — the unmistakable rush of air being displaced with violent speed — heralded danger. Albino's instincts, sharper than ever, screamed a warning. With no time to spare, his body moved of its own accord, on some newly-ingrained reflex, reacting even before his mind could even so much as begin to process the threat.

Ducking low, Albino evaded an assault that came with the ferocity of a storm. The beast, its presence revealed once more by its attempt to strike from behind, missed its target by the barest of margins. The air where Albino had stood moments before was cleaved by the creature's vicious attack, a tangible reminder of the narrow line between life and death in this shadowed confrontation.

The near miss was a jolt to Albino's senses, a clear and present indication of the danger that stalked the halls of the outpost. The beast, relentless and seemingly invulnerable, had once again emerged as a formidable adversary, its agility and lethal intent a mirror to the chaos that had enveloped the facility.
