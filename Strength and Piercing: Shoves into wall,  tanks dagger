Albino watched with grim satisfaction as the man disappeared into the darkness, his fate sealed by his own folly. With a steely resolve, Albino continued his relentless pursuit through the labyrinthine corridors of The Brotherhood's fortress.

With each step up the staircase, Albino encountered more fervent members of The Brotherhood, determined to protect their sanctuary at any cost. As they descended upon him like a swarm of angry wasps, their fanatical zeal only fueled Albino's resolve to bring their reign of terror to an end.

A cultist lunged at Albino with a gleaming knife gripped tightly in his hand, intent on striking down the intruder. Albino moved with lightning speed, seizing the man's head in a vice-like grip. With a powerful thrust, he slammed the cultist's skull into the unforgiving stone wall beside them. The sickening sound of bone meeting brick reverberated through the corridor as the cultist’s head was firmly planted within the hole the blow’d made in the stone wall, his life extinguished in an instant.

But the onslaught did not relent. Another cultist triggered a hidden trap, causing a dagger to shoot forth from an ejection mechanism with deadly precision. The blade sliced through the air like a silent assassin, aimed directly at Albino's heart. The dagger found its mark, but its progress was halted by the impenetrable barrier of Albino's reinforced bone.

Undeterred by the superficial wound, Albino swiftly retaliated. With a swift motion, he tore the dagger from his flesh, his expression betraying no hint of pain. With deadly accuracy, he hurled the blade back towards its origin. The dagger impaled the cultist before he could comprehend what had transpired, his life snuffed out in an instant.
