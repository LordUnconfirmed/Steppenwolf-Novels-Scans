With its vigor fully restored, the beast's demeanor shifts from one of temporary setback to renewed fury, its eyes burning with an untamed ferocity that promises retribution.
Without warning, the beast channels its rage into a display of brute force, turning its attention to a nearby structural element of the facility—a massive, 30-ton steel beam that stands as a testament to human engineering. The beast's assault on the beam is a spectacle of raw power; it collides with the metal, the impact resonating through the air like the clap of thunder, the beam yielding and breaking under the monstrous force. With a heave that showcases the beast's terrifying strength, it uproots the now-broken beam, muscles bulging and tendons standing out against its skin like steel cables.
Growling with anger, the beast hurls the massive steel beam at Albino with a velocity that turns it into a deadly projectile. Albino, faced with the incoming threat, makes a split-second decision that defies expectation. Instead of evading the colossal missile, an action that would have been the most logical and self-preserving, he chooses to confront it head-on. His hands shoot out, grasping the beam as it arrives with a force that could obliterate concrete.
The moment Albino catches the beam, the air itself seems to hold its breath. The weight of the metal, equivalent to the heft of multiple vehicles, is arrested by Albino's outstretched arms. The ground beneath him groans, metal creaking ominously as he holds the beam steady, preventing it from crushing him under its immense mass. 
In the immediate aftermath, as Albino stands holding the beam, the realization of what he's just accomplished—and the potential folly of not dodging it—settles in. The logical course of action would have been to avoid the projectile, yet in the heat of the moment, fueled by the adrenaline and the transformative effects of the serum, he had chosen to catch it, an instinctive decision that bordered on recklessness.
As the dust settled from the clash of titans and he dropped the massive column to the side, Albino found himself at a pivotal moment of realization. Despite his enhanced capabilities allowing him to match the beast blow for blow, a nagging truth lingered in the back of his mind: the creature possessed an innate advantage in both speed and strength.
