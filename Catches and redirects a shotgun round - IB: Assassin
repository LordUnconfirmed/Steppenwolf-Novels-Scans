As the tension in the corridor reached a fever pitch, one of the armored assailants, perhaps driven by desperation or a misguided sense of confidence, made the critical mistake of attempting to shoot Albino at close range. The shotgun's report was a sharp crack in the enclosed twenty-feet space, a split second that might have spelled the end for anyone else. But Albino was no ordinary opponent.

With reflexes that bordered on the supernatural, Albino's hand shot up, a blur of motion that intercepted the bullet's deadly trajectory. Between his thumb and index finger, he caught one of the pellets, a feat that defied belief. The room seemed to fall silent around them, the remaining soldiers frozen as they processed the impossible turn of events. Then, with a precision that was as effortless as it was lethal, Albino flicked the caught pellet back at the shooter with double the kinetic force it had been fired with.

The pellet found its mark, striking the man's exposed neck with a force that sent him staggering backward, a gurgle of shock and pain escaping him as he fell, incapacitated, to the ground. To Albino, the men around him seemed to move as though submerged in water, their reactions and movements agonizingly slow compared to his enhanced perception and speed.

In the moments that followed, the corridor became a tableau of Albino's dominance. One by one, the squad of seven soldiers found themselves outmatched, their attempts to subdue him futile against his superhuman capabilities. Before they fully comprehended the situation, they were all lying on the ground, dead, with causes ranging from neck-snapping to ammunition-redirection to dismemberment, all the result of Albino's strategic and overwhelming counterassault.
