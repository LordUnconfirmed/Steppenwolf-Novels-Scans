Surprise registered in his mind, a flicker of curiosity amidst the stoic demeanor he maintained. He was dressed as always, in his impeccably tailored gentleman's suit, an attire more suited to the boardrooms and urban jungles of the world than the unforgiving wilderness of the South Pole. The suit, a part of his identity as much as his codename or his skills, was hardly appropriate for such extreme conditions. He had always had an unspoken appreciation for the fine craftsmanship of Italian tailoring, a silent concession to a refined taste that his hardened exterior rarely betrayed.

Yet, here he was, standing in the heart of Antarctica, the cold reputed to be fierce enough to claim lives within minutes, and he felt... nothing. No biting wind cutting through him, no shiver-inducing chill, just an inexplicable immunity to the freezing temperatures that surrounded him.

This newfound resistance to the cold was as baffling as it was intriguing. Albino's mind, always analytical, began to piece together the possibilities. The serum, the Osiris Synthesis project's crowning achievement, had altered him in ways he was only beginning to understand. It had not just enhanced his reflexes or his physical strength; it had seemingly reconfigured his very physiology, rendering him impervious to environments that would spell peril for any ordinary man.

As he took his first steps towards the outpost, his path a solitary trail in the untouched snow, Albino contemplated this unexpected development. The serum had unlocked something within him, a potential that transcended human norms and limitations. With each step, he wasn't just moving closer to the outpost; he was walking further into the realm of the unknown, into a future where the definition of what it meant to be human might well be rewritten.
