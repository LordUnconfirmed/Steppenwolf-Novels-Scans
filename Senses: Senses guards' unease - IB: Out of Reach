From above, he could hear the chatter of the guards, their voices filled with confusion and speculation about the supposed accident that had brought him crashing down from the sky. They spoke of commercial planes and failed parachutes, unaware of the true nature of the threat that lay in their midst.

Their guns remained holstered, a sign of their complacency and lack of preparedness for a potential threat. It was a fatal mistake on their part, one that Albino would exploit to devastating effect.
