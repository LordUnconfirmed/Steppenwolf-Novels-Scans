As the android advanced towards him, its mechanical form towering over him like an ominous sentinel, Albino braced himself for the inevitable clash. With a steady gait, the android launched itself at him with startling speed, its movements fluid and precise.

But Albino was ready this time. With reflexes honed by years of training and experience, he intercepted the android's limb mid-attack, his muscles coiled with tension as he halted its advance. With a swift motion, he seized the android's face with his free hand, his fingers closing around its metallic visage with an iron grip.

With a grunt of exertion, Albino summoned his strength, driving the android's head toward the nearby wall with bone-crushing force. The impact reverberated through the corridor, the sound of metal meeting metal echoing in the confined space. Sparks flew as the android's head collided with the unyielding surface, the force of the blow embedding it into the thick metal with a resounding thud.

For a moment, there was silence as Albino stood over his fallen adversary, his chest rising and falling with exertion. But his victory was short-lived, for the android quickly freed itself from its metallic prison, its movements fluid and precise despite the damage sustained.
