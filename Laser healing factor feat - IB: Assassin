As Albino crossed the threshold into the new corridor, his surroundings initially appeared mundane, a stark, elongated passage that stretched before him, its walls a nondescript shade of grey. Despite the apparent normalcy, his instincts screamed a warning, a primal alert to unseen dangers lurking within the seemingly benign environment. With each step, his caution grew, a tangible sense of unease that sharpened his focus.

Without warning, the corridor revealed its true nature. Small openings appeared along the walls, mechanisms whirring to life with a precision that belied their concealed purpose. In an instant, the space was alight with the glow of red-tinted lasers, a network of beams bouncing off reflective pads to create a deadly lattice that moved with alarming intent.

The laser beams, a technological trap of formidable speed, advanced toward Albino. Surprised by the sudden activation and the velocity at which the beams approached, he found himself momentarily caught off balance. In a desperate bid to evade the imminent threat, he stumbled backward, an instinctive reaction that placed him directly in the path of the oncoming lasers.

With no time to fully escape the trajectory of the twin beams, one of Albino's hands, slightly upraised in a futile attempt to shield himself, became the focal point of their merciless precision, severed so cleanly from his arm that it was as though it had been chopped off by a samurai. The sensation was immediate and shocking, a critical moment of vulnerability that was met with a muted cry of pain from the assassin.

Yet, before despair could take hold, the remarkable abilities granted to him by the serum manifested with vivid clarity. The area where the beam had made contact began to regenerate at a pace that was nothing short of miraculous. Tissue and sinew knit together before his very eyes, the process of regeneration erasing the damage with such efficiency that it seemed as though the injury had never occurred.

Shaken but unbroken, Albino rose from his defensive posture, the initial shock of the encounter giving way to a renewed sense of determination.
