Albino understood that while the serum had fortified their bodies against temperature extremes, there were still vulnerabilities to be exploited — the eyes, windows to the soul, and in this case, potential key to victory. If the intense light from the overhead LEDs had been enough to momentarily stagger him earlier, then perhaps light, not heat, could be his weapon.
The clones, for all their physical prowess and resilience, were replicas of him, sharing not just his strengths but also his weaknesses. The realization that his albinism, with its accompanying sensitivity to light, could be the Achilles' heel he needed to target, gave Albino a new tactical focus. The intense brightness of the facility's lights, an environmental factor he'd learned to navigate with caution, could be turned against the clones in a bid to incapacitate them.
Armed with this new understanding, Albino's mind raced to formulate a plan. The gadget had proven ineffective in delivering the kind of damage he'd hoped for, but it had inadvertently provided him with valuable insight into his own biology and, by extension, that of his clones. As the flames continued to rage around him, serving more as a dramatic backdrop than a threat, Albino prepared to leverage the facility's lighting system in his next move against the clones.
In the heated moments following his realization, Albino's gaze locked onto the light switch across the room—the very one the hijacker had manipulated to toy with him earlier. With the clones mirroring his every move, mindlessly intent on their pursuit, he dashed towards it. The switch represented more than just a means to illuminate the room; it was a potential turning point in this bizarre and dangerous encounter.
As Albino reached the switch, the clones were close on his heels, their movements driven by a relentless, if mindless, aggression. With a swift motion born of necessity, he flipped the switch while simultaneously slipping on his red-tinted glasses, a precaution against the sudden onslaught of light he was about to unleash. The effect was instantaneous. The room was flooded with the harsh, bright glare of LED lights, magnified in intensity to levels that would disorient even those without sensitivity to light.
The clones, lacking the protection of tinted glasses and sharing Albino's inherent vulnerability to intense light, were visibly stunned. They halted in their tracks, visibly overwhelmed by the sensory assault, their aggressive momentum broken by the flood of brightness that filled the room. It was a scene that underscored the strange duality of their existence; beings of incredible resilience, yet not immune to the simpler, more primal vulnerabilities of their human origins.
Seizing the moment of disarray, Albino turned to the nearby research mattresses, each equipped with resistant handcuffs — tools of restraint intended for the experiments that had once been the focus of this ill-fated facility. Moving quickly, he dragged the mattresses towards the clones, using the element of surprise and their temporary incapacitation to his advantage.
With a combination of tactical foresight and physical prowess, Albino managed to maneuver each clone onto a mattress. The task was arduous, the clones' bodies heavy with the potential for violence, but Albino's determination was unyielding. One by one, he secured them with the handcuffs, the metal clasps clicking shut in a finality that signaled a temporary victory in this unprecedented struggle.
The clones, now pinned and restrained, growled in frustration and anger, their attempts to free themselves futile against the bindings. Their strength, while formidable, was not enough to break the handcuffs, designed to withstand the immense pressures and stresses of experimental conditions. Hands strong enough to crush iron bricks into rubble flailed, trying to undo the restraints, but it was futile. It was a testament to the facility's preparedness for containment, one he could definitely appreciate.
