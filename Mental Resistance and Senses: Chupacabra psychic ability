As the jet descended, Albino peered out at Octavio's neighborhood, taking in the familiar sights of the bustling streets below. He could sense the Chupacabra's presence like a dark shadow looming over the island, its ominous influence extending its tendrils far and wide. The beast's presence was unmistakable, its psychic energy seeming to pulsate through the very fabric of the city.

Albino knew all too well the extent of the Chupacabra's power. Through their previous encounters and exhaustive research, they had uncovered the creature's ability to control minds through extrasensory means. Its insidious influence could reach every corner of the island, every man, woman and child living in the city of San Juan, manipulating the thoughts and actions of those unwitting folks with unnerving precision and with simultaneity. It was for that very reason that every resident of San Juan was currently locked in their own home, too afraid to leave. That had been the case for the whole day, apparently.

Albino understood the cryptid’s unique power—it didn't wield its abilities for malevolent ends. Instead, it sought only to remain concealed, employing its extraordinary gifts to evade detection by manipulating the thoughts and actions of those around it. By the next morning, the memory of the fearful night they’d endured before would be wiped clean from their psyches, leaving them with naught but the echo of the legend. Millions of minds, manipulated so casually, and all at once...It was an unnerving prospect, indeed, but he the beast was not inherently evil; no animal was.

The Chupacabra's DNA coursing through Albino's veins granted him a similar ability, after all. He could sense the beast's influence attempting to worm its way into his mind, but he remained steadfastly immune to its manipulations. Years of training and conditioning with Donovan, in conjunction with the beast’s DNA within him, had fortified his mind against such intrusion, allowing him to resist and shrug off the creature's ominous control with ease.

As Albino made his way through the bustling streets, he remained vigilant, his senses attuned to any sign of the Chupacabra's influence. He could feel the weight of its presence pressing down on him, a constant reminder of the danger lurking just beneath the surface.
