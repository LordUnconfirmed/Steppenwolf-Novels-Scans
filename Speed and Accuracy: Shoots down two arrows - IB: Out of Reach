The air crackled with tension as the arrows hurtled toward Albino, their deadly tips gleaming in the dim light. But Albino was undaunted. With impeccable timing, he discharged his weapon, each bullet intercepting an arrow with uncanny accuracy. The projectiles collided in mid-air, sending sparks cascading through the chamber as they clashed with violent force.

As the arrows clattered to the ground, the cultist who had unleashed them turned pale, realizing his perilous predicament. With a tremble in his voice, he attempted to flee, but Albino's iron grip seized him before he could make his escape.
