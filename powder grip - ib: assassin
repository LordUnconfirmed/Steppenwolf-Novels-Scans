With surprising agility, Albino counters the beast's attack with a move that catches it off guard: a powerful suplex. The maneuver not only demonstrates Albino's skill but also his immense physical strength, to be expected with the serum that now runs through his veins. He expertly flips the creature over, slamming it onto the ground with precision.

Capitalizing on the beast's momentary vulnerability, Albino shifts tactics. Ignoring traditional martial arts techniques, he opts for a bear hug, relying solely on his newfound power. His muscles, infused with extraordinary strength, tighten around the creature, exerting immense pressure in an attempt to overpower it.

The beast, caught in Albino's vice-like grip, reacts frantically. Its claws lash out in a desperate bid for freedom, while the sound of bones straining under the pressure fills the air. The creature's limbs begin to buckle under force so great it could have crushed slabs of rebar into fine powder.

However, the beast fights back with a primal instinct for survival. It delivers a powerful headbutt, momentarily stunning Albino and seizing the opportunity to break free from his grasp.Yet, the beast is not without resources. In a move driven by instinct and the raw will to survive, it manages to land a headbutt with enough force to momentarily stun Albino, leveraging this brief advantage to wriggle free from his grasp.
