Before he could fully process the situation or react, the guard's assault rifle barked to life. The room was filled with the sharp reports of gunfire, a deadly torrent directed squarely at Albino. The bullets, each a harbinger of destruction, found their mark, tearing through the air with lethal intent.

In the chaos, a fine mist of blood scattered, droplets catching the dim light as they descended towards the metallic ground. The sight, though grim, was overshadowed by a phenomenon far more peculiar. Upon contact, Albino's blood began to interact with the metal in a way that defied expectation. Instead of pooling or smearing, the blood acted as a catalyst, causing the previously stainless steel to corrode and dissolve upon contact, punching fittingly large holes wherever his blood landed and spread, the chemical reaction stopping only where the flow of his blood ceased. The reaction was both fascinating and horrifying, a vivid illustration of the unforeseen consequences of the serum coursing through Albino's veins.

This strange alchemy, his blood's unexpected corrosive property against the metallic floor, once again went largely unnoticed by Albino, whose focus was consumed by the immediate threat. Yet, even as he grappled with the reality of his situation, this bizarre detail lingered at the edge of his awareness, a puzzle piece in the ever-expanding mystery of his own transformation.
