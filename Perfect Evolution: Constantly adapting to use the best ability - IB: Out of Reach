Not giving Kane the ability to think twice, Albino shot forward with the speed of a bullet, his muscles tensing with the familiar surge of adrenaline as he grabbed the man by his throat, lifting him upward. His fingers dug into Kane's flesh, exerting pressure to block off the man's airways and the flow of oxygen, intent on knocking him out and ending the fight once and for all.

But as Albino tightened his grip, expecting Kane to weaken under his grasp, he felt a sudden surge of resistance. Kane's own eyes became fiercer, his muscles tensing in response, and with a burst of unexpected force, he managed to free himself from Albino's hold. It was as if Kane had tapped into a well of strength previously untapped, his movements fluid and powerful.

It hit Albino like a lightning bolt – Kane was also a Heruka. He couldn’t afford to forget that for even a second. Even if Kane was unaware of the depth of his abilities, his body was instinctively adapting, using the best ability available to deal with the situation at hand. Kane's heightened state had likely been triggered as a safeguard, much like Albino's had been in the facility all those months ago.
