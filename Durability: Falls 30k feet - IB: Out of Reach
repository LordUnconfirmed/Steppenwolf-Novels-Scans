With the inconspicuous jet approaching its target, Albino prepared himself for the daring maneuver that lay ahead. In most of his previous missions requiring stealth, he had executed flawless infiltration strategies, slipping into enemy territory undetected and dispatching his foes with deadly precision. But this mission was different. Armed with detailed intelligence on the facility and its defenses, Albino knew that a more direct approach was required.

Once the jet's doors had slid open and the wind rushed in, Albino wasted no time. With a single fluid motion, he launched himself out into the void, hurtling towards the earth below like a missile with no parachute to slow his descent. Thirty thousand feet above the ground, Albino was a lone figure against the vast expanse of sky, his form a mere speck against the backdrop of clouds.

His keen mind raced as he calculated his trajectory, pinpointing his landing spot with razor-sharp precision. The exterior courtyard of the facility stretched out below him, its layout and defenses laid bare in his mind's eye. With a silent determination, Albino braced himself for impact, knowing that every second counted.

In the span of a heartbeat, Albino struck the ground with bone-jarring force, the impact reverberating through his body like a thunderclap. But where any ordinary man would have been crushed by the sheer force of the fall, Albino remained resolute, his training and enhanced physiology allowing him to withstand the punishment without trauma.
