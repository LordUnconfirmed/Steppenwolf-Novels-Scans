The battle between Albino and his clone escalates into a relentless exchange of blows and maneuvers that sees the research room turned into a battlefield marked by destruction. Each movement is a testament to their mirrored strength and resilience, with neither able to secure a decisive advantage over the other. The room bears witness to their struggle, with metal columns bent, twisted or shattered from the force of their collisions, thick walls cracked, folded and pocked with the impacts of their bodies, and carts overturned or shattered from being used as improvised weapons in their fierce combat.
