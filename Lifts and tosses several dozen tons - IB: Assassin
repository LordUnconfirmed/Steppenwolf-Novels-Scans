Albino stood in the aftermath of their tumultuous battle, his mind racing through the next steps he had to take. While the beast lay unconscious, a temporary peace had settled over the scene, but Albino was well aware that this was a mere pause in the storm. The tranquilizer dart embedded in the beast's hide was a temporary measure, a stopgap solution that granted him a precious few hours of reprieve at best. But time was a luxury he could not afford to squander, not with the hijacker's threat looming over the base and the uncertainty of enemy reinforcements drawing nearer with each passing moment.
Surveying the greenhouse, his gaze fell upon the twisted remnants of the large steel gate they had demolished in their earlier confrontation. The gate, now a symbol of their fierce struggle, lay amidst the rubble and shattered glass, its weight and bulk a testament to the ferocity of their encounter. With a plan forming in his mind, Albino approached the gate, his muscles tensing in anticipation of the effort required to lift it. Despite the enhancements granted by the serum, the gate was an imposing mass of metal, a challenge to even his enhanced strength.
With a grunt of exertion, Albino hoisted the gate, feeling the strain in his arms and back as he maneuvered the heavy structure. It was a feat of raw power, a physical assertion of the changes that had wrought his body into something more than human. Moving with purpose, he positioned himself over the beast's prone form and, with a calculated motion, let the gate fall, covering the creature with its considerable weight.
Albino knew this was but a makeshift solution, a flimsy barrier against the brute force the beast would undoubtedly unleash upon awakening. The gate, for all its mass, was unlikely to contain the creature should it regain consciousness, driven by its primal rage and the unnatural strength coursing through its veins. However, options were limited, and in the absence of a more secure method of containment, improvisation was his only recourse.
