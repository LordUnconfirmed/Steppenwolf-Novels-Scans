As Albino launched his assault, he found himself taken aback, albeit not entirely surprised, by the clone's ability to anticipate and counter his every move. When he threw a hook, aimed with precision and power, the clone ducked under it with an ease that suggested foreknowledge of his intentions. It was unsettling, watching his own form mirrored so perfectly, dodging the blow as if it had been rehearsed countless times.

Frustrated but undeterred, Albino switched tactics, aiming a high kick at the clone's head, a move designed to take advantage of his reach and flexibility. Yet, just as the hook had found only air, so too did his kick. The clone sidestepped with a grace that mirrored Albino's own, its movements a shadow of his, predicting and reacting to his strategies with unnerving accuracy.

Determined to test the limits of this eerie prescience, Albino attempted to grapple, to force the clone into a submission hold that would limit its options for escape. Yet, as his hands moved to secure the hold, the clone slipped away, its body twisting out of Albino's grasp with an anticipatory agility that rendered the attempt moot. It was as though the clone possessed an intimate knowledge of Albino's fighting style, able to predict his moves before they were fully executed.

This battle of wits and reflexes escalated with each exchange, a dance of attack and counterattack where Albino found himself perpetually one step behind. The realization dawned on him that this clone was not merely a physical duplicate but a strategic equal, capable of reading his tactics and intentions with a clarity that bordered on telepathic.

The implications were staggering. If the clone could indeed anticipate his moves with such precision, it suggested a level of cognitive and instinctual mirroring that Albino had not considered possible. The fight became not just a test of strength and skill but a deeper, more cerebral challenge. Albino was forced to confront not only the physical manifestation of his abilities in the clone but the strategic and tactical mirror it presented.
