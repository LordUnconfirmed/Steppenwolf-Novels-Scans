Albino had always approached the use of his telepathic abilities with a degree of reluctance, for such intrusions invariably drew forth memories of his uncle, reminders of the family and past he had distanced himself from. Except when absolutely necessary, as had been the case with Haxley, he refrained from exploiting this aspect of his Heruka powers in combat situations. While the fear-inducing ability operated on a similar psychic wavelength, it did not necessitate the same depth of mental engagement and thus did not provoke the same unwelcome flood of personal memories. Direct telepathy, with its intimate invasion of another's consciousness, was a different matter altogether.

But faced with Allen Kane, and the enigmatic nature of his apparent Heruka transformation, Albino found himself compelled to breach this self-imposed boundary and principle. The need to understand, to uncover the truth behind Kane's transformation, outweighed his usual reservations. Focusing his mental faculties, Albino reached out with his mind, attempting to pierce the veil of Kane's consciousness.

The experience was fleeting, a mere brush against the outer edges of Kane's psyche, yet it was profoundly revealing. Kane's mental defenses, bolstered by both his formidable willpower and the natural resistance afforded by his Heruka physiology, repelled Albino's intrusion almost immediately. However, that brief contact was sufficient. Albino glimpsed the truth he had been seeking: Shelly Thompson had administered the last of the Osiris serums to her husband in his sleep, a fact of which Kane himself was unconsciously unaware. The revelation was startling, not least because it confirmed that Kane's assertions of ignorance had been genuine. He truly believed himself unaltered, unaware of the profound transformation his wife had wrought upon him as he lay beside her.
