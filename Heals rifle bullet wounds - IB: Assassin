Caught in the sudden hail of gunfire, Albino felt the impact of the bullets with a clarity that momentarily overrode all other sensations. The force of the shots staggered him, pushing his body back with the sheer kinetic energy, his hands instinctively loosening their grip on his own firearm which clattered to the ground, a metallic echo in the chaos. Yet, before the reality of the wounds could fully register, the serum within him sprang into action. The punctures and tears in his flesh began to close, knitting together with a speed that defied natural biology, erasing the evidence of injury as though it had never been.
This rapid regeneration, while miraculous, was but a momentary distraction. Albino's training and instincts, honed over countless confrontations, kicked in. He lunged at the reanimated guard with a burst of speed that bridged the distance between them in the blink of an eye. His tackle was precise, designed not just to unbalance but to incapacitate, to take the man down to the ground and out of the fight.
