As he stood, brushing off the dust and debris, a fleeting thought crossed Albino's mind, a wish for invisibility, for a means to evade the beast's keen senses. The notion was born of desperation, a silent plea for any advantage in the face of such overwhelming odds.

Yet, even as he entertained the thought, Albino knew that evasion was not a luxury afforded to him in this moment. The beast's ability to detect and engage with such lethal intent left little room for subtlety or stealth. It was a predator of the highest order, its senses finely tuned to the presence of prey, and Albino, despite his enhanced abilities, was squarely in its sights.

As Albino pressed himself against the cold, jagged edges of the hole in the wall, a makeshift refuge created by the guard's unintended impact, time seemed to stretch into an endless void. He was acutely aware of every breath, every slight movement, as he waited for the inevitable assault from the beast. Yet, as the seconds ticked by, morphing into long, tense minutes, the expected attack never came. The silence, punctuated only by the distant, muffled sounds of chaos elsewhere in the facility, was as confounding as it was unexpected.

With cautious movements, Albino edged toward the breach in the wall, his senses straining for any sign of the creature that had been so relentlessly pursuing them. A peek through the debris revealed an empty room, the beast conspicuously absent from the scene of recent turmoil. The realization that it had seemingly vanished without a trace was disorienting. It defied the nature of the encounter, the beast's previous aggression and persistence.

This sudden absence triggered a cascade of thoughts in Albino's mind, a rapid reassessment of the situation under the lens of recent, unexplainable events. His fleeting, desperate wish for invisibility in the face of such a formidable predator now took on a new, intriguing dimension. Could it be, he pondered, that in the heat of the moment, his body had instinctively activated a previously unknown ability? An ability induced by the serum that had already proven its capacity to radically enhance and protect his physical form.

The notion was not entirely without merit. If the serum could heal wounds with unprecedented speed, could it not also adapt his physiology in other, more subtle ways? Ways that could mask his presence, making him effectively invisible to the keen senses of the beast. It wasn't true invisibility in the sense of science fiction, but rather a biological camouflage, an ability to suppress the physical signs — heat, the displacement of air, perhaps even the subtle chemical signals of his body — that predators use to track their prey.

This potential explanation, as speculative as it was, offered a moment of clarity. It suggested that, under extreme stress, his body could instinctively trigger this camouflage, a latent defense mechanism unlocked by the serum. The implications were profound, suggesting that the serum had not only enhanced his physical capabilities but had also woven into his very biology the means to evade detection by predators as formidable as the beast.

The realization imbued Albino with a cautious sense of optimism. If he could indeed control this ability, understand it and harness it, he would possess a significant advantage. For now, though, the immediate benefit was clear: the beast's departure had granted him a precious opportunity to regroup, to plan his next move without the immediate threat of being hunted.

With the beast absent from the room, Albino took a moment to gather himself, to adjust to this new understanding of his capabilities, before crouching just a tad and slipping through the hole, his arms grasping the rims carefully. The facility around him, with its labyrinthine corridors and hidden dangers, suddenly seemed less daunting. He was not just a survivor in this hostile environment; he was an anomaly, a variable that the beast — and perhaps even the architects of the serum — had not anticipated.

Leveraging his newly discovered capability for enhanced stealth, Albino began to navigate the complex web of the facility with a grace and efficiency that belied the urgency of his mission. His movements were deliberate, each step taken with a precision that minimized noise and maximized the element of surprise. This was a different kind of confrontation, one that played to the strengths bestowed upon him by the serum — a dance of shadows and silence.
