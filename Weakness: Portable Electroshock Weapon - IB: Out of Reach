With the weight of impending transformation bearing down on him, Albino's mind raced with urgency. He knew he had a mere ten minutes before the heightened state consumed him, transforming him into a beast beyond recognition. It was a risk he couldn't afford to take, not with Kane still posing a threat.

As he grappled with his rapidly diminishing window of time, memories of the first time he'd tapped into this primal form flooded his mind. Donovan and his team had meticulously studied the aftermath, searching for a solution to counter the dangerous side-effects. It was then that they had devised a potential lifeline: a portable electroshock weapon, compact and discreet, capable of delivering a powerful charge to temporarily neutralize the Heruka cells coursing through his veins.

Albino's fingers clenched around the memory of the device, its image burned into his mind like a lifeline in the darkness. The weapon, disguised as a simple nail file, packed the voltage of a Tesla coil into a nondescript everyday object, its sleek design belying its deadly potential. With a flicker of hope, Albino realized that this might be his only chance to end the conflict without succumbing to the beast within.
