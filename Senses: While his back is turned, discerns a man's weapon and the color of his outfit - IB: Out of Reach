Before he could dwell too long on the unsettling sensation, Albino's thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the sensation of a cold metal barrel pressing against the back of his head. His muscles tensed instinctively as a voice cut through the silence, commanding him to drop his weapon.

A smirk danced across Albino's lips as the voice behind him commanded him to drop his weapon and raise his hands. Slowly, deliberately, he turned his head just enough to catch a glimpse of the man standing behind him, his expression a mask of calm defiance.

"Sure thing," Albino replied, his voice dripping with a casual nonchalance that belied the tension crackling in the air. "But before I do that, let's have a little chat, shall we?"

The man's grip tightened on his weapon, but Albino could sense the flicker of uncertainty beneath the surface. With a subtle shift of his stance, he continued, "You're holding a Glock, aren't you? Nice choice. Personally, I've always been more of a 'Deagle' guy myself. There's just something about the weight of it in your hand, you know?"

The man's eyes widened in surprise, a hint of apprehension creeping into his voice as he replied, "How... How did you know that?"

Albino chuckled softly, his tone mocking yet oddly serene. "Oh, I have my ways," he said cryptically, his gaze locked on the man's figure. "And speaking of ways, I couldn't help but notice your outfit. Green, isn't it? Reminds me of my old military days. How about you? How long have you been in the service?"

The man's composure wavered, his confidence faltering under Albino's piercing gaze. "That's none of your damn business," he snapped, his voice tinged with frustration. "Now drop your weapons and put your hands above your head, or I'll shoot."
