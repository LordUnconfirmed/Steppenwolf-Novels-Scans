Seizing upon this advantage, Albino spotted a metal cart nearby, its surface gleaming under the emergency lighting.
With a burst of calculated aggression, Albino grasped the cart, channeling all the force at his disposal into propelling it forward. The cart, turned projectile by his formidable strength, hurtled towards the clone with unerring accuracy. The clone, already struggling with the impaired vision the gas induced and unable to anticipate the attack, found itself squarely in the path of the oncoming metal mass.
The impact was as swift as it was brutal. The clone was caught off-guard, the force of the collision pinning it against the nearby steel wall with such intensity that the metal dented inward, warping around the clone's form. The clone became embedded in the damaged wall, trapped by the sheer physicality of Albino's counterattack.
