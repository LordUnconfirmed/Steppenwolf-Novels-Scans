But as he emerged from the depths of his memories, Albino was brought back to the present by Reggie's voice, cutting through the silence like a knife. The sound jolted him from his reverie, snapping him back to reality with a start. Reggie's easygoing tone grated on Albino's nerves, a stark reminder of his own shortcomings.

Reggie leaned back in his chair, eyeing Albino with a hint of amusement dancing in his eyes. "So, what's got you so lost in thought, Albino? Planning your next grand entrance, I presume?"

Albino's jaw clenched at Reggie's jest, his gaze narrowing ever so slightly. He knew Reggie was well aware of his distrust towards Kane and Crimson, and he braced himself for the inevitable jab.

Reggie's smirk widened as he continued, his tone laced with mock innocence. "Or is it because, you know, both Kane and Crimson have shown you up before? I mean, who can forget Crimson's little victory over you? Quite the trickster, that one."

Albino's grip on the armrest tightened imperceptibly, his silence speaking volumes. He refused to dignify Reggie's taunts with a response, but inwardly, the memories of Crimson's "victory" gnawed at him. It wasn't a true defeat; Reggie had orchestrated the entire scenario. Albino had played the fool, deliberately missing his shots during his infiltration mission on Crimson's boss’s office, while also pretending he could not immediately sense her from her hiding spot as she held out the cable to electrocute him. It was all a ploy to bait Crimson and lure her into the fold of the X-Creatures Project by thinking she’d ‘just barely’ managed to outsmart Donovan.
