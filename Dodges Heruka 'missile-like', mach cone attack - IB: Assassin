As the beast lunges, its formidable bulk a missile aimed directly at him, Albino steps aside with an ease that belies the gravity of the situation. It's a dodge that speaks volumes of the change he's undergoingâ€”a shift that elevates his reflexes and spatial awareness to a level where the beast's once-fearsome speed seems just close enough to manageable, predictable even.
This newfound edge, this enhancement of his physical capabilities, doesn't just enable Albino to evade the beast's attack; it affords him a moment of revelation. For a fleeting second, as he sidesteps the creature's charge, Albino wonders at the extent of this transformation, at the latent powers unlocked by the serum and perhaps now catalyzed by the direness of his situation.
The beast, a creature of instinct and primal fury, registers its shock not with words but with a brief falter in its relentless assault, missing its target by nearly fifteen feet before it can recover. Its surprise is palpable, an animalistic reaction to an outcome it had not anticipated. For a creature accustomed to the certainty of its physical supremacy, the evasion of its prey is a disconcerting anomaly. It stumbles, a momentary lapse in its otherwise unyielding aggression, but its survival instincts are quick to reassert themselves. With a snarl that rumbles through the air like thunder, it regroups and launches itself at Albino once more, a living missile of muscle and malice moving swiftly enough to cause the air to swirl around it in the shape of a cone.
