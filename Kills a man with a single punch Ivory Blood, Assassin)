Albino moved with silent precision, his form barely a whisper against the backdrop of chaos that had overtaken the outpost. The decision to engage was not taken lightly; it was a calculated move, driven by the necessity of his mission and the urgent directives from Reggie. As he closed the distance between himself and the guard, Albino was keenly aware of the weight of his actions, the balance of life and duty precariously in his hands.

In the solitude of the corridor, his approach was unnoticed, the guard's attention fixed on the potential dangers that lay ahead, unaware of the immediate threat that approached from behind. Albino's focus was singular, his target unaware and unprepared for the impending confrontation.

The moment of contact was a test of the new limits of Albino's strength, a physical manifestation of the serum's effects on his body. With precision honed through years of training and combat, Albino delivered a strike to the back of the guard's head, a move intended to incapacitate, to swiftly neutralize the threat without unnecessary harm.

Even he could not anticipate what happened next, as the blow landed with such force that the manâ€™s skull audibly cracked. He did not even so much as whimper, the sound of his body falling with a sudden thud on the floor and the trinkets of blood around it were the only marks left by the deadly strike.
