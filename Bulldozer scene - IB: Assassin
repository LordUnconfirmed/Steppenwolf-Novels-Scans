Suddenly, without warning, the bulldozer beside which they had sought refuge became the focal point of an unimaginable force. Struck with a power that seemed to defy the limits of the natural world, the massive machine was dislodged from its position with alarming ease. It toppled, a behemoth of metal succumbing to the unleashed might of the creature. The impact as it hit the ground was monumental, sending shockwaves through the room, the sound a deafening roar that echoed off the walls with all the vengeance expected of a twenty-ton colossusâ€™s collapse.

In the chaos of the moment, amidst the dust and the noise, there was a singular figure who remained conscious, a testament to the extraordinary resilience bestowed upon him. Albino, despite being pinned under the massive weight of the bulldozer, was miraculously unharmed, a fact that spoke volumes of the serum's effect on his body. Any other human would have died immediately. His temporary comrades certainly had.

With determination fueled by the urgent need to survive, Albino tapped into the depths of his newfound strength. It was a Herculean effort, born of desperation and the will to overcome. Straining against the immense weight, he began to push, his muscles protesting under the exertion. Inch by inch, he managed to move the bulldozer, a feat that under ordinary circumstances would have been deemed impossible.

The bulldozer, once a protective barrier, now a crushing trap, slowly began to lift off him. Albino's efforts were superhuman, the serum coursing through his veins empowering him to act beyond the limits of human endurance. The vehicle rose three feet, five feet, seven feet above the ground, and with one final, monumental push, he succeeded in hurling and righting the bulldozer, pushing it back onto its original position with a force that rivaled that of the creature's attack.
