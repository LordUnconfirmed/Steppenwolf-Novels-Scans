In the chaotic aftermath of the table's collapse, an unintended consequence quickly became apparent. The bottles that had been perched precariously on the table's surface were now victims of the scuffle, shattering upon impact with the hard floor. From the broken glass, a thick, green, and sickly gas began to waft into the air, filling the room with an eerie haze. The gas, a byproduct of the chemical substances the bottles contained, diffused rapidly, creating a noxious atmosphere that carried with it an unmistakable sense of danger.
Albino felt an immediate reaction, a peculiar pull beneath his eyelids, as if the gas was trying to seduce him into closing his eyes, to surrender to the soporific effect it suggested. Yet, beyond this mild irritation, the gas seemed to hold no dominion over him. His body, already a testament to the extraordinary capabilities bestowed upon him by the serum, proved resilient against the chemical's more insidious effects. However, the gas did not dissipate as quickly as he had hoped, instead lingering to create a haze that reduced visibility within the room.
This reduction in clarity could have been a disadvantage, but Albino quickly realized that the clone, lacking the protective eyewear that corrected his own naturally poor eyesight, was likely to suffer far more from the compromised visibility. Seizing upon this advantage, Albino spotted a metal cart nearby, its surface gleaming under the emergency lighting.
