Continuing his relentless advance through the facility, Albino rounded another corner, only to be met by another pair of soldiers. Alerted by the sounds of their fallen comrades, these two were on high alert, their fingers tight on the triggers of their M16s. At the first sight of Albino, without hesitation or a moment's pause for identification, they opened fire, their rifles roaring to life in a deadly chorus aimed squarely at him.

But for Albino, enhanced beyond the ken of ordinary men, the world around him seemed to decelerate, each bullet's path becoming starkly visible, almost tangible, in the air before him. He reacted as the bullet were mere feet from his face, his body sprawling in a calculated and graceful dive that rendered the soldiers' gunfire futile, the bullets whistling harmlessly overhead.

In the space of a heartbeat, before the echo of the shots had even begun to fade, Albino was moving again. Rising from his evasive maneuver with the fluidity of motion that defied the rugged terrain of combat, he launched himself at the pair of soldiers. His approach was a blur, a streak of determined vengeance that covered the ground between them in the blink of an eye.
