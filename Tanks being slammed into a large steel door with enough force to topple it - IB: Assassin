Reacting with the quick reflexes honed by his training and enhanced by the serum, Albino fires a nerf dart from the shotgun with a speed that rivals that of a bullet. The dart, bright and incongruous amid the grim setting of their battle, whistles through the air towards its target. The beast, however, showcases its own remarkable agility, ducking under the dart with an ease that speaks to its natural prowess. The miss is but a brief interlude in the beast's relentless assault as it crashes into Albino with the full force of its momentum.
The collision is monumental, a clash of forces that sends both combatant and beast hurtling through the air. Albino, despite bracing himself for the impact, is unable to withstand the sheer power behind the beast's attack. Their flight through the facility is a blur of motion and noise, culminating in a spectacular crash through a large steel gate that yields to their combined mass and velocity like paper.
They break into an unexpected oasis amid the chaosâ€”a greenhouse. The lush greenery and meticulously maintained plants present a stark contrast to the destruction that marks their path. Albino, even in the midst of combat, can't help but note the absurdity of stumbling upon such a serene environment in their deadly dance. The thought that the facility's team had prioritized a greenhouse, of all things, in this fortress of science and survival brings a momentary flash of humor to the grim situation.
However, any amusement quickly fades as Albino realizes the beast is atop him, their bodies entangled in a mess of limbs and foliage. The ground beneath them, a carpet of earth and broken glass, bears witness to their violent entry. They wrestle, each struggling for dominance in this unexpected arena. The beast's weight is oppressive, its strength undeniable, but Albino matches its force with a resilience born of desperation and the unnatural abilities granted to him. The proximity, so close that he can feel the beast's ragged breath, turns the fight into something primal, a struggle not just for survival but for supremacy.
