With a fluid motion that belied the tension of the moment, Albino moved to ensnare the clone, aiming to lock it into the Gogoplata's choke. The technique involved using his shin to press against the clone's throat while securing the back of the clone's head with his hands, a move that, if successful, would leave the clone with no option but to submit or pass out.

However, the clone, mirroring Albino's skill and perhaps anticipating his intent to introduce an element of surprise, countered with alarming speed. In a swift reversal of fortunes, the clone leveraged Albino's momentum against him, maneuvering them into a position where it was Albino who found himself caught in a chokehold. The clone's arm was like a vice around his neck, pressing inexorably against his windpipe and steadily cutting off his air supply. The pressure built, a tangible darkness creeping into the edges of Albino's vision as oxygen became a dwindling resource.

Faced with the looming threat of unconsciousness, Albino's survival instincts surged to the forefront. His tactical mind, ever calculating, identified a potential escape in the environmentâ€”a nearby metal table, laden with equipment and materials. With the last reserves of his strength, he shifted their entangled bodies, maneuvering them toward the table with a desperate determination.

Then, with a precise application of force, Albino managed to topple the table in their direction. The sudden movement and the imminent threat of the table crashing down upon them forced the clone to reassess its priorities. The clone, wary of the falling bottles and the unpredictable outcome of staying locked in the chokehold, reluctantly released its grip on Albino to avoid being hit.
