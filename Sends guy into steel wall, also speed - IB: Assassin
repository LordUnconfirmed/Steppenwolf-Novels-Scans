A lone figure stood guard at a doorway, a sentinel posted at the threshold of knowledge. The man was armed, his attention fixed on the corridor ahead, unaware of Albino's approach. Clutched in his hand was a device that Albino recognized immediately — a compact, watch-like gadget that functioned as the facility's secondary gate controls. The schematics he had studied earlier, provided by the guards who had first escorted him into the chaos, had detailed its importance. He supposed the man had used to it to seal the facility’s gates once more, upon hearing the hushed reports from his dying encounters who’d been encountering the beast.
Identifying himself as a non-threat would be key to navigating this encounter without unnecessary conflict. "I'm not here to fight," Albino announced, his voice steady, as he stepped into the guard's line of sight. The guard, startled, raised his weapon instinctively, the tension palpable in the air between them.
Albino kept the conversation light, a casual exchange designed to lower the guard's defenses and assess his intentions. However, every word, every moment, was a calculation, a setup for the decisive action that would follow.
Then, with a speed that regular human eyes could just barely follow, Albino struck. His hand flashed out, a blur of motion that connected with the guard's wrist, knocking the gun from his grasp with a precision born of countless hours of training. Before the guard could react, before the reality of his disarmament had fully set in, Albino delivered a powerful kick.
The force of the blow was monumental, propelling the guard backward with a velocity that defied expectation. He flew a dozen feet, a projectile powered by Albino's serum-enhanced strength, before crashing into the steel door with a resounding impact. The collision was violent, the door buckling under the force, the guard's body becoming an unintended key that embedded itself into the metal barrier.
Capitalizing on the unexpected opportunity created by the guard's collision with the door, Albino wasted no time. The impact had compromised the door's integrity, the metal warped and dented, a testament to the force exerted in the confrontation. With the pathway to his objective momentarily clear, Albino sprang into action, his movements a blend of urgency and precision.
He dashed towards the doorway, his eyes fixed on the guard's form, still lodged within the metal. The guard was motionless, a silent casualty of the escalating conflict within the facility. Albino's approach was swift, each step propelling him closer to his goal, his mind already calculating the next move.
With a final burst of speed, Albino reached the door. Without hesitation, he applied another forceful slam against the guard and the weakened structure. This time, his efforts bore fruit — the metal tore under his assault, bending and ripping immediately, forming a man-shaped hole. It was a crude method of entry, born of necessity and the unique circumstances of his enhanced abilities.
As he stepped through the makeshift entrance, Albino didn't pause to survey the damage. His focus was singular, aimed at retrieving the control device from the guard's limp form. The gadget, small and unassuming, was a key piece of technology within the outpost, capable of granting or denying access through the facility's labyrinth of doors and gates.
