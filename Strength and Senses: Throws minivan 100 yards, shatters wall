Albino's muscles tensed as he sprinted towards the mangled minivan, remnants of their earlier clash strewn around the warehouse like debris from a storm. With a surge of raw strength, he hoisted the vehicle off the ground, feeling the strain in his arms as he prepared to unleash it as a weapon against Kane.

With a primal roar, Albino hurled the minivan towards his adversary, the metal frame slicing a hundred yards through the air with deadly precision. Kane's instincts kicked in just in time as he ducked beneath the incoming projectile, his body moving with the agility of a seasoned fighter. The minivan hurtled past him, crashing into the warehouse wall with the force of a supersonic jet, sending shockwaves reverberating through the structure.

The impact was deafening, the sound of twisted metal and crumbling concrete echoing in the cavernous space as an entire segment of the building wall crashed. Dust and debris filled the air, obscuring Albino's vision as he scanned the chaos for any sign of movement. His senses, honed to razor-sharp perfection, cut through the haze as he locked onto Kane's location with all the uncanny precision of a man who could’ve sensed a foe’s feet touch the ground from the other end of a football field.
