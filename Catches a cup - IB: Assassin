The confirmation seemed to resonate with the team, a collective sigh of relief subtly permeating the room. "You've been out for about three hours," Reggie added, providing context to the blank space in Albino's recent memory.

As the conversation continued, a researcher approached to offer Albino a cup of water, a mundane gesture that unexpectedly turned into a display of the serum's profound impact. The cup slipped from her grasp, a moment of human error that would normally result in a minor, inconsequential spill. But the world, as perceived by Albino, shifted dramatically.

Time seemed to stretch, each millisecond elongating as if granting Albino the luxury of deliberation. His body responded with a swiftness that defied normal human reflexes. His hand shot out, the movement a blur to the onlookers, and caught the cup mere inches from the floor. The water, barely disturbed within its confines, settled calmly as Albino righted the cup, his actions as fluid and precise as a well-rehearsed dance.

The researcher, along with the rest of the team, stared in disbelief. The room, previously filled with the soft hum of machinery and muted conversation, fell into a stunned silence. The simple act of catching a falling cup had transformed into a clear demonstration of the serum's effectsâ€”Albino's reflexes, his speed, his control over his body had been enhanced to a level that bordered on the superhuman.

Reggie, his eyes wide with a mixture of astonishment and realization, met Albino's gaze. He quickly regained his composure, however, the initial shock giving way to a familiar, irreverent humor. He let out an appreciative wolf-whistle, a light-hearted attempt to normalize the extraordinary display they had just witnessed. "Nice reflexes there," he quipped with a grin, his tone light but his eyes still reflecting a hint of awe. "You could give ol' Iron Mike a run for his money, you know."
