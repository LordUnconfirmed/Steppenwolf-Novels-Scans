However, just as Albino prepared to unseal the large metal door at the end of the hallway, a sudden disturbance caught his attention. His instincts screamed a warning as the door was violently ripped from its hinges, hurtling towards him with alarming speed. With reflexes honed by years of training and experience, Albino attempted to evade the incoming projectile, but it was too late. The door struck him with bone-jarring force, sending him sprawling backward several dozen feet before crashing to the ground in a tangle of limbs, the metal foor cracking beneath him.

Admittedly disoriented, Albino shook his head and regained his bearings. Blinking away the stars dancing before his eyes, he forced himself to focus, his senses on high alert as he assessed the situation. And what he saw left him momentarily speechless.

Standing before him, amidst the wreckage of the door, was a figure unlike anything Albino had ever encountered: an android, its sleek metallic frame gleaming in the dim light of the corridor. Despite the gravity of the situation, Albino couldn't help but offer a quip, his dry wit cutting through the tension like a knife.

"Oh, are we turning this into a bad sci-fi movie from the '80s now?" Albino remarked, his voice laced with a hint of sarcasm as he pushed himself upright. Despite the odds stacked against him, there was a glimmer of amusement in his eyes, a testament to his unshakeable resolve in the face of danger.
