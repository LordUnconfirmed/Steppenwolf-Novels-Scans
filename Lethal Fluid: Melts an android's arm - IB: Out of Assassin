With a sudden burst of pain, he bit down on his own lip with such force that chunks of flesh tore away, blood flowing freely from the wound.

Albino watched with grim satisfaction as the android's palm and parts of it forearm began to melt before his eyes, its once-formidable strength reduced to nothing more than a pile of twisted metal and circuits.
