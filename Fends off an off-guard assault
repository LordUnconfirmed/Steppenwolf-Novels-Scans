However, the outpost was not done with him yet. As he advanced, confident in his approach, a sudden force struck him from behind. A guard, unseen and unaccounted for, had launched a desperate attack, catching Albino off-guard. The impact was substantial, enough to drive the air from his lungs and send both men crashing to the ground.

Pinned down, Albino felt the weight of his assailant pressing down on him, the desperation of the guard manifesting in the strength of his grip. For a moment, the roles were reversed, the hunter becoming the hunted, the predator momentarily subdued by prey that refused to go quietly. Albino's mind, ever calculating, raced to assess the situation, to find the leverage he needed to turn the tables once again.

The guard had the element of surprise and a solid grasp, his training evident in the way he moved and held Albino down. But he was unaware of the caliber of opponent he had engaged. Albino, so long ago known in certain circles as the Phantom Lynx, was still every bit the master of martial arts that he was before, his abilities honed to a razor's edge through relentless practice and countless confrontations.

Pinned beneath the guard, Albino's mind remained clear, his focus unbroken. He could feel the determination of his attacker, the pressure and intent behind each movement. But Albino's understanding of combat was deep and intuitive, each nerve and muscle in his body trained to react with precision and purpose.

With a swift assessment of the guard's position and leverage, Albino began his counter. It was a sequence of fluid, deliberate movements, each one a calculated step in the dance of combat that he knew so well. Shifting his weight, he created the necessary space to maneuver, his body responding with the trained instinct of a seasoned fighter.

In one smooth motion, Albino managed to alter the dynamics of their struggle, slipping out from under the guard's hold. It was a move that spoke of his deep knowledge of grappling, a skill set that was as much a part of him as his ability to wield weapons.

Now free from the immediate threat of submission, Albino quickly transitioned to offense. With the guard momentarily disoriented from the reversal, Albino seized the opportunity. He applied a guillotine choke, his arm locking in place around the guard's throat with clinical precision. The technique was executed flawlessly while he was still laying down, his understanding of leverage and anatomy allowing him to apply the maximum force where it was most effective.

The pressure on the guard's windpipe was unyielding, a vice of flesh and bone that left no room for escape or resistance. In those final moments, the guard's struggle weakened, his movements becoming less coordinated, more desperate, until they ceased altogether. Albino held the choke a moment longer, ensuring the threat was completely neutralized, before releasing his grip.

The guard lay motionless. Standing up, Albino adjusted his attire, the calm demeanor returning to his face as if the confrontation had been nothing more than a brief interlude in his mission.

With the path clear once again, Albino continued towards the rendezvous point, his steps steady and resolute.
