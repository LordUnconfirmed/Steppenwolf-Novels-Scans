With a surge of adrenaline, Albino sprang into action, his senses on high alert as he dodged the android's relentless onslaught. As blow after blow rained down upon him, Albino quickly discerned a pattern in the android's attacks. It was able to unleash one devastating move with lightning speed, but afterward, it lagged slightly as it entered a cooldown phase.

Taking advantage of this opening, Albino launched a counterattack, his movements fluid and precise as he danced around the android's attacks as though he could see the future â€“ his clone had done the same against him, so many years ago, but unlike it, he had a profound understanding of his own capabilities now. With each dodge and weave, he closed the distance between them, his fists striking with deadly accuracy as he exploited the android's momentary weakness.

Sparks flew as Albino's blows connected with the android's metallic frame, each impact reverberating through the corridor like a thunderclap.
