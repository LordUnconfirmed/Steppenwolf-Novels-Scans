The researcher swallowed hard, his throat dry with fear as he awaited his fate. But to his astonishment, Albino did not retaliate. Instead, the assassin's gaze lingered on him for a long moment, his expression inscrutable.

"In my current state," Albino began, his voice measured and calm, "I could snap your neck with as much effort as it takes to swat a fly. I could tear through this entire room like a tornado, leaving nothing but carnage in my wake. I once threw a goddamn Abrams tank across a basketball court. If I decided to fling this little knife with even half as much force, youâ€™d not even have the leftovers of a head to make that stupid decision again. I could make sure that happened right now, in fact..."

The researcher's breath caught in his throat, his heart hammering in his chest as he braced himself for the inevitable blow. But to his surprise, Albino's next words were unexpected.

"But I won't," Albino declared, his tone surprisingly gentle. "Not today, at least. Consider yourself lucky, for I'm feeling... merciful, for the time being."
