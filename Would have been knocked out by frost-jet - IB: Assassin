Navigating the labyrinthine passageways with practiced ease, Albino finally arrived at the critical juncture. The steel door, a massive barrier to his objective, loomed ahead, sealed shut as if to mock his efforts. Undeterred, Albino reached for the watch-like gadget strapped to his wrist, its screen flickering to life under his deft touch. He began the unlocking sequence, his fingers moving with precision over the holographic interface.
The silence of the corridor was suddenly pierced by a soft, almost ethereal murmur. Albino's instincts, honed through countless encounters, screamed a warning. He didn't hesitate, hurling himself to the side just as the corridor was engulfed in violence and a frost-jet crashed into the rebar-reinforced wall with catastrophic force. The impact sent shockwaves through the structure, rubble and dust billowing into the air, creating a gaping hole as large and wide as he was tall where solid and thick concrete had stood moments before.
Lying in a crouch, Albino assessed the aftermath. The frost-jet, its hover engines whining in protest, was now in mere tatters beyond the hole in the wall, its sleek form shattered by the collision. Had he been a fraction slower, he would have found himself directly in the path of the jet, certainly rendered unconscious, allowing the hijacker a chance to possibly flee the scene unchallenged. Wanting to spare himself more trouble from behind, so to speak, he quickly used the gadget to seal the doorway behind him, surmising that none of the footsoldiers summoned to retrieve the hijacker had access to the controls.
