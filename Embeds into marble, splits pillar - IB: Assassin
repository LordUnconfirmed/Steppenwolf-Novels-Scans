Once free, Albino wasted no time. He immediately focused on the clone that had pinned him, gripping its face with a firm hand. With a burst of strength enhanced by the serum coursing through his veins, he shoved the clone towards the marble column that adorned the room next to him. The force behind his action was monumental, sending the clone headfirst into the column with such impact that its head was buried a full foot into the stone. The collision sent small slivers of marble debris flying, a visual echo of the force exerted.

But Albino was far from finished. His senses, sharpened to a razor's edge, detected the second clone's approach from behind. Without hesitation, he intercepted the clone's arm just as it was about to strike. Leveraging the momentum of the attack against the clone, Albino executed a flawless Judo throw, using the clone's own force to his advantage. The throw sent the clone hurtling towards the same marble column with devastating accuracy.

The impact was catastrophic for the structure. The column, already compromised by the first clone's violent introduction, could not withstand the additional assault. It split cleanly, the integrity of the marble giving way under the combined stress of the impacts. With a groan of stressed stone, the top half of the column slid off its base half, a once-sturdy pillar now reduced to a falling weapon.

The descent of the column was a slow-motion spectacle of destruction. It toppled onto the clones with a finality that echoed through the room, the sound of fifteen feet of marble meeting flesh and bone a dull thud that signified the end of the encounter. The column pinned both clones beneath its weight, a makeshift tombstone for the mindless duplicates of Albino himself.

Even as the dust settled around the fallen column, Albino stood watching.

The resilience of the clones, as they effortlessly extricated themselves from under the weight of the marble column, was no shock to Albino. After all, they were molded from his very essence, possessing the same remarkable healing abilities granted to him by the serum.
