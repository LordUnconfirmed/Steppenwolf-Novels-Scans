for a showdown between hunter and hunted, between man and beast.
In the tense moments leading up to the beast's charge, Albino experiences a profound shift within himself, a sensation that transcends the adrenaline surge of impending combat. It's as though his very blood ignites, coursing through his veins with a fiery intensity that sharpens his senses to an unprecedented degree. His vision tunnels, honing in on the advancing threat with a clarity that borders on the preternatural. The world around him, previously a whirl of motion and danger, decelerates as if granting him the courtesy of time to react, to strategize.
This internal transformation is bewildering to Albino, a mystery layered atop the already complex puzzle of his enhanced abilities. Yet, there's no time to ponder the why or howâ€”not when the beast, a creature of raw power and fury, is barreling towards him with lethal intent. In this crystalline moment of heightened perception, Albino finds his body responding with a fluidity and precision he's never known. The beast's movements, so swift and deadly to any other, unfold before him with a clarity that feels almost leisurely.
