“I want to introduce a new dimension to your training,” Sterling said, his voice a mix of sternness and excitement. Ivor regarded him, his curiosity piqued.

Sterling began, “What do you know about the Indian and Chinese arts of targeting pressure points?”

Ivor’s reply was tinged with a hint of skepticism, “The stuff of martial arts movies, right? Masters knocking people out without even touching them, or with just a light tap.”

A soft chuckle escaped Sterling, a sound that seemed out of place in the dojo’s atmosphere of discipline. “Those scenes have given rise to quite the myths,” he admitted. “Con artists have made a show of such things, but there’s no mystical force at play there.”

His expression sobered as he locked eyes with Ivor. “However, the underlying principle is rooted in truth. Pressure points exist; they are precise spots on the body that, when manipulated correctly, can cause immense pain and incapacitate an opponent. Understanding this can elevate your fighting to a higher level.”

Ivor’s earlier amusement faded as he absorbed Sterling’s words. The idea was intriguing, yet it sounded dangerously close to the line between practical martial arts and the mystical nonsense often sold to the gullible.

Seeing the hesitance on his nephew’s face, Sterling added, “It’s not about theatrics or magic. It’s anatomy, pure and simple. If you know the vulnerable points on the body, you can use them to your advantage.”

The room was quiet except for the distant sound of others training. Ivor focused on Sterling, seeing not just his uncle now, but his sensei—someone who had, time and again, proven his knowledge in the art of combat.

Sterling continued, “And it's time you learned one of the most effective techniques: the real version of the 'Death Touch'—or Dim Mak, as it’s traditionally known.”

The name conjured images of legendary fighters and whispered tales of deadly masters. Ivor's earlier reservations melted away, replaced by an acute awareness of the potential such knowledge held.

Over the next several weeks, Sterling took Ivor through an intense regimen. It wasn't enough to know the locations of the pressure points; Ivor had to understand how to reach them on an opponent who was moving, defending, and trying to do the same to him.

They started with charts and dummies, mapping out the human body's vulnerable spots. Ivor committed them to memory, drilling over and over, touching each point on the dummies until the locations were imprinted in his mind.

But theory was just the beginning. The practical application was a more arduous task. Ivor sparred with Sterling, learning to sense the flow of a match, to predict movements and find fleeting opportunities to test what he had learned.
