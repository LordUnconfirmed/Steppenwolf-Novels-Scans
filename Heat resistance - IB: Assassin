Albino was already moving, his mind a step ahead. He sprinted towards the welding kit-shaped gadget, his plan crystallizing with every stride. The clones may have shared his resilience against ballistic and blunt force trauma, but as far as he knew thus far, he had no such resistance when confronted with extreme heat or fire. Burns, melting fleshâ€”these were damages that the serum's rapid regeneration might not so easily overcome.

As he reached the gadget, the clones hot on his heels, Albino's hands worked quickly to activate it. His intuition told him that fire could be the equalizer he needed, a way to inflict damage that the clones' miraculous healing couldn't immediately reverse. It was a gamble, but one grounded in the logic of his extraordinary experiences.

In a swift, decisive motion, Albino pressed the activation button on the gadget, his instincts immediately guiding him to duck for cover. The device responded with a ferocious outburst of fire, a roaring torrent of flames that surged forward with a life of its own. The fire enveloped the space where the clones pursued, engulfing them in its incendiary embrace. Albino, shielded momentarily from the direct assault of the flames, spared a glance towards his adversaries, expecting to witness their demise.

To his astonishment, the clones emerged from the inferno with little more than grunts of discomfort, their forms outlined against the blaze, seemingly impervious to the heat that would have spelled certain death for any normal human. It was a jarring realization for Albino; the same serum that rendered him unyielding to the Antarctic cold now protected these duplicates from the searing heat. As he stood, engulfed by flames that danced around him with a heat intense enough to warp and melt metal, Albino found the fire to be little more than a nuisance, its fierce temperature failing to harm him in any meaningful way. The discomfort was there, an irritation that pricked at his senses, particularly at his eyes, which watered in the smoky, heated air.

This moment of discomfort sparked a flash of insight.
