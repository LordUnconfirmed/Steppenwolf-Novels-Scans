The stark, fluorescent lighting cast harsh shadows, turning the football-field-long space into a stark tableau of light and darkness. Albino moved with purpose, his senses finely tuned to any sign of threat, his body a coiled spring ready to react.

The Desert Eagle was in his hand in an instant, its barrel aligning with the target with practiced ease. The shot rang out, echoing off the walls, and the guard was down before he could even comprehend the source of his demise, a clean shot to the head that left no room for doubt or survival.
