As the situation escalated, one of the guards, positioned farther off, took aim and fired at Albino. In this moment, Albino realized that the oddly heightened abilities he had experienced during his confrontation with the beast were gone, reverted back to what theyâ€™d been when he first set foot into the facility, likely a side effect of the electroshock. Yet, this realization did not deter him; his training under his uncle had prepared him for combat in all forms, with or without the serum's enhancements.

Albino's reaction to the incoming bullet was not driven by the superhuman reflexes that had allowed him to perceive time as if it were slowed but by an acute sharpness of his senses that remained undulled. He predicted the bullet's path, timing the closure of his fingers with precision that bordered on preternatural. The bullet came to a halt in his grasp, a feat that, while not borne of the same extraordinary speed as before, was no less impressive.

This display, a blend of skill and keen perception, was enough to unnerve the remaining guard. The sight of Albino catching a bullet, regardless of the method, sparked a fear that cut through the soldier's training. He turned, an instinctive reaction to flee, but Albino was already acting. The gunshot that followed was swift, a clear indication of Albino's lethal proficiency, with or without the serum's full effects.
