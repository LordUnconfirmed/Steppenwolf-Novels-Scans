The clone, its vision restored, doesn't immediately resume its physical assault. Instead, it emits a piercing scream, a sound laced with an inexplicable power that seems to reach directly into Albino's mind. It's an assault of a completely different nature, one that targets not the body but the psyche. Albino felt an intense pressure bearing down on his consciousness, an invasive force that triggers a cascade of thoughts and emotions to surge to the forefront of his mind. Memories, fears, desires—all flood in with the overwhelming intensity of millions of minds speaking and attempting to overcome his stability at once.
It's an extra-sensorial barrage, and its suddenness and depth catch Albino off guard. He's thrust into a tumultuous sea of mental noise, struggling to maintain his sense of self amidst the deluge. Yet, even as he's bombarded by this onslaught, a part of him fights to regain control, to push back against the invasive force seeking to overpower his mental defenses. With a grunt, he managed to shield his mind, warding off every bit of the attack, expulsing that tingling sensation emanating from deep within his brain still.
In the aftermath of this apparently-psychic assault, Albino was left to ponder the implications of what he's just experienced. The possibility that the clone might possess abilities beyond physical mimicry—specifically, some form of telepathy or mind-reading—suddenly doesn't seem so far-fetched. His earlier speculation, once a mere hypothesis about the clone's capacity to anticipate his moves, now takes on a new, chilling dimension. The attack on his mind suggests that the clone's understanding of him might run deeper than shared genetics and physical prowess; it might extend into the realm of cognitive and emotional mimicry as well.
