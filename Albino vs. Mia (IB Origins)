Ivor's pulse buzzed in his ears, his recent victory over Eli still echoing in the minds of those watching, his underdog status freshly toppled.

Mia, smaller than the growing fourteen-year old with a black belt snugly tied around her waist, held a graceful yet formidable presence. Her eyes, flinty and assessing, mirrored the years of training she’d undertaken under Sterling's watchful eye.

As the spar commenced, Mia moved first, her kick slicing through the air towards Ivor’s torso. He shifted, barely avoiding the skilled strike, feeling the whisper of it pass him. His heart hammered, understanding that Mia’s experience was leagues above Eli’s and his own.

Her attack was a flow, each movement a cascade into the next. Ivor parried and dodged, grappling with the continuous stream of offensive techniques she dished out. Several times, he found himself barely escaping submission, his limbs entwining with hers in a desperate bid to avoid being pinned.

But Ivor was not simply a participant in this dance; he was an observer, his mind cataloging, decoding, and learning with every evasion, every near miss.

Despite his defensive maneuvers, Mia’s experience began to shine. She managed to slip through his guard, securing a tight guillotine choke. Ivor's throat contracted against the pressure, his lungs screaming for reprieve as he was forced into a stooping position, Mia’s arm locked around his neck.

But even as his airway constricted, Ivor’s eyes, flickering with resolve, locked onto Sterling, who was watching intently from the sideline. Ivor's mind clicked, recalling a moment weeks prior when he'd observed his uncle practicing with another advanced student.

With little room to maneuver and Mia cinching tighter, Ivor adapted. His hands, swift and purposeful, worked to secure Mia’s arm, preventing her from applying further pressure. His free arm snaked around the back of her neck as he repositioned his base, his form mirroring the technique he’d seen Sterling execute: the Von Flue choke.

Mia’s confidence wavered as she sensed the shift, feeling her own breathing become labored as Ivor applied pressure to her neck, using her own choke against her. Her grip around Ivor’s neck weakened as she grappled to free herself from the surprising counter-technique, her lungs clawing for air.

A muffled thud echoed as Mia’s hand tapped the mat, surrender cascading through her arm and into her fingers. Ivor, releasing her instantaneously, stepped back, offering her space to rise, his chest heaving with exerted breaths.

The dojo fell into a stunned silence before sporadic whispers, like wind through leaves, began to circulate. Sterling stepped forward, his eyes, usually stoic, sparkled with an unreadable emotion as he gazed upon Ivor.

Ivor and Mia bowed to each other, an unspoken respect passing between them, before she stepped away, her expression a myriad of frustration, respect, and contemplation. Ivor turned towards Sterling, questions dancing in his eyes.
