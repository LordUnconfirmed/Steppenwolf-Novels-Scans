Albino, standing in the eye of the storm, feels a calm clarity that belies the chaos unfolding around him. As the beast charges, he does not retreat or sidestep but instead chooses to confront the onslaught directly. His hand extends, a gesture of defiance against the brute force barreling towards him. There's a moment of surreal stillness, a split second where the outcome hangs in the balance, before contact is made.
The impact is monumental, a collision of forces that should, by all accounts, have been catastrophic for Albino. The beast's hand, a weapon honed by nature to kill, carries the might to demolish structures of steel and concrete, to hurl bulldozers as it had done before. Its claws, sharp enough to rend steel with grotesque ease, meet Albino's skin. Yet, the expected devastation does not come. Albino's hand, guided by a strength and resilience that are as much a surprise to him as they are to the beast, catches the lethal limb. The sharpness of the claws, which would have once torn through him with fatal ease, now only leaves superficial marks, the serum coursing through his veins rendering him nearly impervious to such assaults.
With a force born of this newfound prowess, Albino redirects the momentum of the beast's attack, not just stopping it but actively throwing it to the side. The movement is more than a mere physical rebuke; it is a statement, a declaration of his refusal to be dominated. The beast, caught off-guard by the unexpected resistance, is hurled away, its mass and velocity used against it. It lands with a crash that echoes through the facility, a tangible sign of Albino's defiance.
