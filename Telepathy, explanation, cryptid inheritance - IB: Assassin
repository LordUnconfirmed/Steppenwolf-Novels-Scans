Albino, grappling with the revelations about his transformed state, probed further into the depths of his newfound capabilities. "And these extrasensorial abilities, the telepathy... how do they fit into this?" he questioned, seeking clarity on the psychic phenomena he had unwittingly tapped into.
Jules Haxley, still ensnared within the psychic grip Albino had unknowingly exerted, provided an answer that seemed to deepen the mystery of Albino's transformation. "Your psychic abilities," he began, "stem from the Chupacabra DNA that's been synthesized into your system. The Chupacabra, as legend has it, evades capture not just through physical prowess but through its psychic ability to sense and manipulate the thoughts and perceptions of those around it. With its DNA coursing through your veins, you've inherited a similar capacity, just as with all other cryptidsâ€™ abilities."
He paused, reflecting on the significance of his own words. "It's not just about sensing danger or reading thoughts... it's about influence, about an awareness that extends beyond the physical realm. That's why you can connect with others' minds, why you can push thoughts into their consciousness and control them. It's a profound, if not entirely comprehensible, aspect of your evolution."
