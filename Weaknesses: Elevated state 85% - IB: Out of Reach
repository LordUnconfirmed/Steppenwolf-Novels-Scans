Not wanting to stay locked in this endless dance with Kane forever, Albino decides to tap into the same 'elevated' state he'd encountered long ago in the facility. His blood seems to ignite, his eyes glaze over, taking on a redder hue, a physical manifestation of his determination and the Heruka DNA coursing through his veins. As he'd learned from Haxley and his own grueling months of training, this transformation was essentially an acute boost in the flow of Heruka white blood cells within his bloodstream, dramatically augmenting his superhuman traits.

The tests they'd conducted showed a significant problem, however; remaining in this enhanced state for too long risked letting the flow of Heruka cells surpass eighty-five percent of his total count. The same fate that had befallen Shelly, transforming her into a monstrous version of herself, loomed over him if he wasn't careful. He'd lose all semblance of rationality, his body grotesquely morphing into a mutated, beast-like form, potentially with no return to his human consciousness. It was a risk, but one Albino was willing to take in the heat of the moment, knowing full well he had a narrow window of about ten minutes to harness this power effectively before he needed to be forcibly knocked out of the form.
