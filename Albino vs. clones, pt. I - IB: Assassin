As the clones lunged with a ferocity that betrayed their mindless origin, Albino's mind flashed back to a distant memory — a time when he and his uncle had stood back to back, facing down a cadre of ten martial artists. That experience had honed his ability to manage multiple attackers, to find calm and precision in the eye of a storm. Drawing on that reservoir of skill and determination, Albino prepared to engage these eerie doppelgangers of himself.

The first clone made a beeline for him, its movements eerily mirroring Albino's own potential for speed and aggression. But Albino was ready; his body moved with the fluidity of a seasoned fighter, sidestepping the charge with a grace that belied the tension of the moment. His hands reached out, gripping the clone's arm in a practiced motion, and with a swift application of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu technique, he executed a perfect arm-drag.

Using the momentum of the maneuver, Albino turned the clone's own force against it, hurling the disoriented figure towards its counterpart. The impact of the two bodies colliding was satisfying, a brief moment where Albino felt he had the upper hand. However, the satisfaction was short-lived. The clones, imbued with a resilience that matched his own, quickly recovered from the collision. Shaking off the daze, they fixed their sights on him once more and charged with renewed vigor.

Albino, undeterred, readied himself for the next phase of the confrontation. He aimed a calculated strike at the leading clone, targeting the solar plexus with a technique designed to incapacitate — the Dim Mak, or Death Touch. It was a move that had felled many opponents, a concentrated burst of force that disrupted the body's internal functions. But to his dismay, the clone seemed unaffected by the attack, its body absorbing the blow without any sign of distress.

This unexpected immunity caused a moment of hesitation in Albino, a split second where doubt crept in. That moment was all the clones needed. The leading clone capitalized on Albino's falter, tackling him with a force that bore them both to the ground. Pinned beneath the weight of his assailant, Albino found himself in a precarious position, the clone's face a grotesque mirror of his own, inches from his.
