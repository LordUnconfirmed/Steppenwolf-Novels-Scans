Albino's training and instincts, honed over countless confrontations, kicked in. He lunged at the reanimated guard with a burst of speed that bridged the distance between them in the blink of an eye. His tackle was precise, designed not just to unbalance but to incapacitate, to take the man down to the ground and out of the fight.

On the ground, Albino wasted no time. His movements were a blur, a seamless integration of martial arts precision and the lethal efficiency of the Dim Mak strikes he had mastered. Each hit was targeted, a disruption of the body's neural processes that left the guard unable to retaliate or escape. It was a display of skill and power, a testament to Albino's mastery over his enhanced abilities and his understanding of the human body's vulnerabilities gained training under his uncle so long ago.

With the guard effectively immobilized, Albino turned his attention back to his firearm. He retrieved it from where it had fallen, his movements fluid and assured despite the adrenaline coursing through him. The gun felt familiar and right in his hands, an extension of his will and a tool to end the threat once and for all.

Turning back to the guard, Albino faced the man who had risen unexpectedly from presumed death, who had turned from victim to assailant in the span of moments. There was a finality in Albino's stance, a resolve that spoke of decisions made in the heat of battle, of lines crossed in the name of survival and mission objectives. The guard, already weakened and compromised by Albino's expertly executed strikes, was unable to defend himself, unable to do anything but await the inevitable conclusion of their encounter.

And then, with a decisiveness that left no room for doubt, Albino acted. The sound of the gunshot was abrupt, a sharp exclamation point that echoed off the walls of the room, marking the end of the confrontation. The reanimated guard's threat was neutralized, his second attempt at life abruptly ended as Albino stood untouched.
