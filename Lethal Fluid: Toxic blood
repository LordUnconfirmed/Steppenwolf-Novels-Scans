He hesitated for a moment, considering his options. He’d normally just shoot the man dead as he did in pretty much every situation, but drawing too much attention to himself in such a public place was risky, but leaving the cultists alive was equally dangerous. In the end, there was only one course of action available to him.

With a deliberate motion, Albino leaned over the unconscious cultist, his lips curling into a silent snarl. He spat directly into the man's open mouth, the corrosive fluid sizzling as it made contact with his lips.

The cultist sputtered and gagged awake, his eyes widening in terror as he realized what had happened. But it was too late. The Heruka blood, infused with Albino's lethal essence, coursed through his veins like a venomous tide, wreaking havoc on his body with ruthless efficiency. Corrosion damage notwithstanding, consuming Heruka blood was highly poisonous and toxic to living entities – within mere instants, the men’s organs would be swelling and bursting from the inside.

Albino watched impassively as the cultist convulsed and writhed in agony, his screams drowned out by the sound of crashing waves. The next minute, he’d fallen silent, his body still and lifeless as death claimed him.

A sense of grim satisfaction settled over Albino as he surveyed the scene before he got back to Octavio’s jeep and kept on driving.
