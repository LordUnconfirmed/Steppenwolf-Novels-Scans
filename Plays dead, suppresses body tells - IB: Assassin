Albino's momentary lapse, caused by the unexpected resurgence of memories and the disorienting headache, left him vulnerable. Two nearby soldiers, seizing the opportunity as they crossed the hall, struck with precision, delivering a jolt from a taser that coursed through his body with unforgiving intensity. The shock was enough to render him unconscious, his body going limp as the electrical current overwhelmed his senses.
Minutes later, consciousness crept back to Albino, a slow dawning that brought with it the awareness of his precarious situation. He lay on the cold floor, the murmur of voices and the shuffle of feet indicating that the soldiers were standing guard over him. Recalling the earlier incident where he had instinctively masked his presence from the beast, Albino decided to employ a similar tactic. With deliberate focus, he 'played dead,' suppressing his body's natural tellsâ€”heat signature, the rise and fall of his chest with each breath, even the subtlest of movements and twitches that might betray his wakefulness.
As he lay in wait, a plan forming in his mind, Albino sensed the moment when the soldiers' vigilance waned, their attention momentarily diverted. Seizing the opening, he surged to his feet with a fluidity that belied his recent incapacitation. His hand snaked out, grabbing a gun from the holster of an unsuspecting soldier whose back was momentarily turned. Before the man could react, Albino had already pulled the trigger, the sound of the gunshot sharp and final.
The suddenness of Albino's action threw the other soldiers into disarray. They scrambled to respond, but Albino was a step ahead, moving with a precision and speed honed by years of training and combat. He dispatched them swiftly, each shot a testament to his deadly accuracy.
