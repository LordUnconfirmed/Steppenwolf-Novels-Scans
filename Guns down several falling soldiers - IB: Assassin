The room lay exposed, the hijacker's figure momentarily caught off guard by the sudden breach. Albino's eyes quickly adjusted to the scene unfolding before him. The room, vast and starkly illuminated, was dominated by the imposing silhouette of a medium-lift helicopter, its rotors spinning in anticipation of a swift departure. Fifty feet ahead, a figure clutching a thumb drive — unmistakably the hijacker — made a desperate dash toward the awaiting escape. In that instant, Albino's training and instincts converged, guiding his actions with unerring precision.

Without hesitation, he raised his rifle, taking aim at the helicopter's only lifeline to the fleeing man — the rope ladder dangling invitingly. A burst of gunfire severed the ladder, its ends fraying and whipping in the air, as Albino redirected his fire toward the helicopter itself. The bullets peppered the fuselage, a metallic storm that heralded the vehicle's forced descent. Alerted by the gunfire, several guards, poised for action inside the helicopter, leapt out in an attempt to neutralize the threat.

But they were met with Albino's ruthless efficiency. Each guard, caught mid-air in a ballet of violence, was systematically shot down, their bodies going limp before they even touched the ground. The precision of Albino's gunfire left no room for counterattack, ensuring that by the time they landed, they were no longer a threat.
