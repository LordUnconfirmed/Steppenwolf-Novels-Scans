As Albino grappled with the android, memories of past encounters with foes encased in metallic frames flooded his mind. Donovan's rigorous training regimens had subjected him to countless simulations and combat scenarios, each one designed to push him to his limits and prepare him for the challenges he would inevitably face in the field. One such encounter stood out vividly in his memory, a brutal struggle against a man clad in thick steel armor

The man had been a formidable opponent, his movements fluid and precise as they clashed in a deadly dance of combat. Albino had quickly realized that brute force alone would not be enough to overcome his adversary's defenses. But Albino had never been one to shy away from unconventional tactics. In a moment of desperation, he had unleashed his dread-inducing ability, causing the man's heart to seize up with sheer terror. It was a move born out of necessity, but even Albino, with all his lack of scruples, had felt a pang of remorse at having killed such a worthy foe for the sake of a spar.

But this was not the same situation. The android before him lacked the vulnerability of a human heart, its mechanical frame impervious to such tactics. Yet Albino was undeterred. With a steely resolve, he focused on the task at hand, his mind racing as he searched for a weakness to exploit.
