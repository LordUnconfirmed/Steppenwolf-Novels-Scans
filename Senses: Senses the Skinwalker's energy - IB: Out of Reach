As Albino stood just outside the door, his senses heightened to a razor-sharp edge, he could feel the tension in the air thickening with every passing moment. Before him lay his objective: a heavily guarded room filled with researchers, equipment, and an ominous presence that sent shivers down his spine. He knew without a doubt that the cryptid they sought lay within, its essence pulsating with an otherworldly energy that seemed to defy comprehension.

Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Albino pushed open the door and stepped into the room, his eyes scanning the scene before him with keen intensity. The room was bathed in harsh fluorescent light, casting long shadows that danced across the walls. Researchers scurried about, their movements frantic as they tended to their duties, oblivious to the danger that lurked in their midst.

But Albino's attention was drawn to the center of the room, where a large, egg-shaped container stood ominously. He could feel the presence of the Skinwalker within, its essence radiating with a malevolent energy that made his skin crawl. There was something inherently wrong about it, something that sent a chill down his spine and set his nerves on edge.
