Albino had always approached the use of his telepathic abilities with a degree of reluctance, for such intrusions invariably drew forth memories of his uncle, reminders of the family and past he had distanced himself from. Except when absolutely necessary, as had been the case with Haxley, he refrained from exploiting this aspect of his Heruka powers in combat situations. While the fear-inducing ability operated on a similar psychic wavelength, it did not necessitate the same depth of mental engagement and thus did not provoke the same unwelcome flood of personal memories. Direct telepathy, with its intimate invasion of another's consciousness, was a different matter altogether.
