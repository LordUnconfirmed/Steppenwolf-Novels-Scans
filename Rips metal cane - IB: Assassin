Wasting no time, Albino capitalized on the momentary advantage, his body already moving in anticipation of the clone's next attack. He could hear the rapid, heavy footsteps of the clone as it charged towards him, a testament to its undiminished aggression and determination. In a fluid motion, Albino reached out to the side of a board, where a metal cane was affixed as part of the room's accoutrements. His fingers barely closed around it, but with a smooth, practiced motion, he tore it free, ignoring the tickles caused by the static, the cane coming away in his hand to serve as an improvised weapon.
The timing was impeccable. As the clone closed the distance, Albino pivoted, turning to face the oncoming threat head-on. With a swift, calculated swing, he brought the metal cane down in a wide arc, the weapon connecting with the clone's head with a resounding impact, his other hand out to keep his balance. The hit was direct, unmitigated by anticipation or evasion, a clear indication that the clone, for all its ability to predict and counter Albino's familiar moves, was ill-prepared for tactics and styles it had not seen him use before.
