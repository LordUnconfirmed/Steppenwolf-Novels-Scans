With the immediate danger neutralized, Albino's attention snapped back to the hijacker. The man, momentarily dazed by the abrupt turn of events, was no match for Albino's speed. Closing the distance between them with a few powerful strides, Albino reached out, his grasp firm but controlled as he tossed the hijacker aside like a rag doll, ensuring he was out of the way but not fatally injured. The hijacker skidded across the floor, the thumb drive still clutched in his hand, a symbol of all he had risked and all he was about to lose.
Albino then turned his focus to the helicopter, now grounded but still a potential avenue of escape. Approaching the vehicle with determined strides, he reached out, his hands finding purchase on the helicopter's undercarriage. Muscles tensing, he exerted his strength, a display of raw power that seemed to defy the laws of physics. With a heave, the helicopter tipped, rolling onto its side in a cacophony of grinding metal and shattering glass. The pilot, realizing the futility of his position, ejected from the cockpit, only to be met by Albino's unwavering aim. A single shot rang out, and the pilot fell, another casualty in a night that had already seen too many.
Turning back to face the hijacker, Albino's expression was one of grim determination.
