Whirling around to face the new threat, Albino's reflexes were tested once again. From the corner of his eye, he caught the motion of a green bottle, hurled with surprising force from a nearby table. The throw was precise, the trajectory aimed directly at him. There was no time to dodge; the bottle smashed against his body, shattering on impact and releasing its contents onto his skin.
The liquid within was immediately reactive, sizzling upon contact with the air and his flesh. It was some sort of acidic mixture, potent enough that droplets which missed Albino and hit the floor began to eat through the metal, creating rapidly expanding holes with a hiss that filled the air. Yet, to Albino's astonishment, where the acid touched his skin, there was no pain, no searing damage that one would expect from such a caustic substance. There was a sensation of discomfort, a wrongness that made his skin crawl, but it lacked the destructive effect that the acid wrought on inanimate materials. The serum within him, it seemed, offered protection even against chemical assaults designed to corrode and destroy.
