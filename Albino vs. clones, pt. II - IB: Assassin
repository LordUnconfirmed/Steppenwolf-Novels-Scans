This unexpected immunity caused a moment of hesitation in Albino, a split second where doubt crept in. That moment was all the clones needed. The leading clone capitalized on Albino's falter, tackling him with a force that bore them both to the ground. Pinned beneath the weight of his assailant, Albino found himself in a precarious position, the clone's face a grotesque mirror of his own, inches from his.
Lying there, pinned and momentarily at a disadvantage, Albino's mind raced. The clones' immunity to his Dim Mak technique was a complication he hadn't anticipated, a variable that changed the calculus of the fight. As he grappled with the clone, struggling to regain the upper hand, he knew he needed to adapt, to find a new strategy. The situation called for innovation, for a shift in tactics that could turn the tide back in his favor.
The realization that the clones lacked his martial arts expertise provided Albino with the opening he needed. Their mindless aggression, while formidable, could not compensate for the absence of trained combat intuition. Seizing the moment, Albino executed a series of deft maneuvers to extricate himself from beneath the clone. His movements were precise, a testament to his extensive training, as he reversed the mount with a practiced ease that spoke volumes of his skill.
Once free, Albino wasted no time
