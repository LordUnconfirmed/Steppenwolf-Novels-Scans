As Albino continued his relentless advance through the facility, a thought flickered through his mind, a wish for a more efficient way to deal with the soldiers that seemed to materialize at every turn. The urgency of capturing the hijacker pressed heavily on him, fueling his desire for speed and efficiency. The slightest delay could afford the hijacker the opportunity to escape, undermining all of Albino's efforts and the sacrifices made along the way.
Caught in this contemplation, Albino experienced an unexpected shift in perception. It was as though his mind, resonating with his unvoiced wish, extended beyond the physical confines of his skull, reaching out into the facility with an extrasensory tendril. This sudden expansion of awareness was disorienting, the influx of information from the thoughts of everyone within the facility overwhelming him and inducing a sharp headache.
The sensation was startling, both for its suddenness and for the sheer breadth of awareness it conferred upon him. For a brief moment, Albino stood frozen, his mind awash with the thoughts, intentions, and locations of the facility's occupants. It was an intrusion, unbidden but not entirely unwelcome, into the minds of his adversaries. Soldiers' positions, their strategies and immediate orders, the flicker of fear in some and determination in others—all laid bare before Albino's newfound perception.
This sudden gift of extrasensory perception caught him entirely off-guard. Albino had been no stranger to the enhancements and alterations his body had undergone since the injection, but this—this was a realm of ability he had not anticipated. The mental map it provided was intricate and detailed, offering a tactical advantage he had only wished for moments before.
Yet, with this influx of sensory information came the challenge of processing it. The minds of dozens pressed in on him, a cacophony of thoughts that cluttered his own focus. It took a monumental effort of will for Albino to sift through this deluge, to isolate the information relevant to his mission from the noise that accompanied it.
Albino's momentary lapse, caused by the unexpected resurgence of memories and the disorienting headache, left him vulnerable. Two nearby soldiers, seizing the opportunity as they crossed the hall, struck with precision, delivering a jolt from a taser that coursed through his body with unforgiving intensity. The shock was enough to render him unconscious, his body going limp as the electrical current overwhelmed his senses.
Minutes later, consciousness crept back to Albino, a slow dawning that brought with it the awareness of his precarious situation.
