As Albino dismounted from the jeep and strode toward the castle, telling Octavio to stay here because the entire ordeal would be over soon, his gaze honed in on the figure standing guard at the entrance. The man, cloaked in a tattered cape and clutching a gleaming knife, exuded an air of menace that matched the castle's foreboding facade.

Stopping a few paces away from the guard, Albino regarded him with a mixture of amusement and disdain. The guard's warning to back off only fueled Albino's determination, his resolve unyielding in the face of adversity.

"Yeah, how 'bout no," Albino quipped, his tone laced with sarcasm, before springing into action. With lightning speed, he closed the distance between them, his muscles coiled like springs ready to unleash their pent-up energy.

In one swift motion, Albino seized the guard by the collar, effortlessly hoisting him into the air with a single hand. The guard's eyes widened in shock as he struggled against Albino's iron grip, his futile attempts to break free falling short.

With a grunt of exertion, Albino hurled the guard toward the sturdy mortar door behind him. The force of impact sent shockwaves reverberating through the castle walls as the guard collided with the unyielding surface, his body embedding a full foot into it like a ragdoll.

Undeterred by the chaos unfolding around him, Albino wasted no time in pressing his advantage. With a determined roar, he charged toward the guard, his momentum propelling him forward like a force of nature.

As he neared the fallen guard, Albino launched himself into a powerful tackle, the sheer force of his impact enough to shatter the door into a splintered mess. The sound of crumbling masonry echoed through the entrance hall as Albino surged forward, his path now clear.

With a triumphant smirk, Albino stepped over the wreckage of the door, his eyes alight with determination. The Brotherhood may have thought themselves untouchable, but Albino was about to show them that no fortress could withstand the fury of a determined assassin.
