A light chuckle escaped him, a soft sound that was incongruously calm given the circumstances. He met Albino's gaze, a slight smile playing on his lips, as he softly refused to divulge the secrets he held. His laughter seemed to suggest a confidence that his plans, whatever they may have been, were still very much in motion, or perhaps a belief in the inviolability of his mission.
As Albino locked eyes with the hijacker, his gaze penetrated deep, as if intending to unearth the secrets buried within the man's mind. It wasn't long before the hijacker's demeanor shifted, his eyes glazing over as if he were being drawn into a deep, inescapable trance. This sudden change took Albino by surprise, yet he realized it was the manifestation of the extrasensorial telepathic ability he had inadvertently accessed before. This time, however, he was conscious of it happening, the influx of thoughts and emotions from the hijacker flooding into his mind like a torrential downpour.
Albino fought to maintain control, to sift through the deluge of information that threatened to overwhelm him. It was a struggle to isolate the hijacker's thoughts from the cacophony, but as he honed in on the man's inner voice, he commanded, "Tell me everything." His voice was firm, leaving no room for disobedience.
Under the influence of Albino's telepathic command, the hijacker began to speak, his voice distant yet compliant. "JH-2030... That's what they call me. My real name is Jules Haxley," he began, his tone almost robotic as if he were reciting facts from a distant memory. "Son of the owner of the Haxley Corporation. We're... we were Donovan's rivals in the healthcare industry."
