As one of the guards crouched down to check Albino's pulse, he seized the opportunity with lightning-fast reflexes. In one fluid motion, he lunged forward, snatching the guard's gun from its holster and turning it on him before he could even react. The sound of gunfire echoed through the courtyard as Albino dispatched the guard with ruthless efficiency.

The other guards sprang into action, their shouts of alarm filling the air as they reached for their weapons. But Albino was already one step ahead. With deadly precision, he picked off each guard in quick succession, his movements fluid and precise. The courtyard erupted into chaos as the guards fell one by one, their bodies crumpling to the ground in silent testament to Albino's skill.

Within moments, the threat had been neutralized, the courtyard littered with the bodies of the fallen guards. Albino rose to his feet, his expression unreadable as he surveyed the scene before him.
