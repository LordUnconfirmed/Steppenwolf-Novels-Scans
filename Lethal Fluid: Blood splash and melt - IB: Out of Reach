As Albino rounded the corner, his senses on high alert, he was met with the sight of a man standing before him, gun in hand. Before Albino could react, the man's finger tightened on the trigger, sending a bullet hurtling towards him. Albino may have been fast, but even he, in his regular state, could never hope to stack up to gunfire -- the bullet swiftly found its mark, striking him squarely in the neck.

Pain surged through Albino's body as the bullet tore through his flesh, blood spurting from the wound in a crimson arc. For a brief moment, he staggered, before reigning himself in and ignoring it. But even as his senses reeled from the shock of the impact, Albino remained resolute. This was all part of his plan.

As blood spilled from the wound, splashing against the man's face, a deadly transformation began to unfold. Albino's blood was no ordinary substance; it was laced with acidic properties, a lethal cocktail designed to incapacitate and destroy anything it came into contact with.

With a sickening hiss, the acidic blood began to eat away at the man's flesh, its corrosive effects spreading like wildfire across his features. The man's screams of agony were quickly muted as his face began to melt away, flesh and bone dissolving into a grotesque puddle of bubbling gore.

Albino watched with grim satisfaction as his assailant collapsed to the ground, his once-human visage now nothing more than a twisted mass of melted flesh even as the bullet wound in Albinoâ€™s neck disappeared, his healing ability ablaze.
