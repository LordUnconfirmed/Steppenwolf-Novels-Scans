In the dimly lit warehouse, the confrontation between Albino and Allen Kane escalated rapidly. Kane, driven by a blend of desperation and defiance, launched himself at Albino, who, despite being momentarily caught off guard and knocked off-balance enough for his glasses to slip off, reverted to his extensive combat training. With practiced ease, Albino countered, flipping Kane onto the ground and securing him in a pin, the cold concrete floor of the warehouse pressing unforgivingly against Kane's back.
Albino, his expression as unreadable as ever, attempted to apply the Death Touch, a technique he had mastered over years of rigorous training. To his astonishment, Kane's body did not respond as expected; there was no seizing of muscles, no halting of breath. It was as though Kane's physiology somehow neutralized the lethal technique, a revelation that momentarily widened Albino's eyes behind the lenses of his fallen glasses.
