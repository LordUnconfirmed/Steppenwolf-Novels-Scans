In the wake of the beast's disorientation, Albino seizes the initiative with predatory precision. His body coils and then uncoils in a burst of kinetic energy as he sprints toward the momentarily vulnerable form of the beast. There's a palpable intensity to his movements, a physical assertion of the dominance he's begun to establish over this contest of wills and strength.

As he closes the distance, Albino's leg rears back, then rockets forward in a kick delivered with such power that it transcends the bounds of mere human capability. The impact is thunderous, a concussive release of force that reverberates through the facility's structure. Under the weight of this blow, the metallic floor itself protests, warping and buckling as if made of something far less substantial than steel. The beast is sent skidding across this suddenly malleable surface, its massive body carving a chasm in the metal, a fifteen-feet long physical scar etched into the architecture of the facility. Rubble, torn from the floor in spades, peppers the trail of its passage, marking the path of Albino's assault.

Yet, for all the spectacle of the attack, the beast's recovery is swift, a testament to its own formidable nature. It regains its footing with a fluidity that belies its size, the ease of its movement a stark counterpoint to the violence of its displacement. The creature's eyes, glowing with a predatory light, fix upon Albino once more. In any other context, the sheer ferocity of its gaze might have been enough to cow or even paralyze an opponent with fear. But Albino is no ordinary opponent. Albino meets the beast's gaze without flinching, his own eyes a mirror to the determination that fuels him.
