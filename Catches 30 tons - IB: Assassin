Suddenly, the beast redirects its fury towards a towering steel beam nearby, a colossal structure weighing 30 tons, a testament to human engineering. With a primal roar, it charges at the beam, the impact echoing like thunder, as the metal yields under its monstrous force. With a display of terrifying strength, the beast wrenches the now-broken beam from its foundation, muscles bulging and tendons standing out against its skin like steel cables.

Snarling with rage, the beast hurls the massive steel beam at Albino with lethal speed. Facing the incoming threat, Albino makes a daring choice. Instead of dodging, he reaches out and catches the beam, stopping its deadly trajectory with his bare hands. The air holds its breath as Albino bears the weight of the metal, equivalent to multiple vehicles, preventing it from crushing him under its immense mass.

In the aftermath, as Albino stands amidst the debris, the realization dawns upon him. While catching the beam may have seemed reckless, it was an instinctive decision fueled by adrenaline and the transformative effects of the serum. As he drops the massive column to the side, he understands that brute force alone won't secure victory against the beast. He needs to adapt, to outsmart his opponent by utilizing his surroundings and resources to their fullest potential. Just as he had done against the clones, turning their strengths into weaknesses, he must employ a similar strategy now to triumph over the beast.

With this in mind, Albino shifted his approach, his movements becoming more purposeful as he maneuvered through the wreckage-strewn environment. His eyes scanned the area, searching for anything that could be turned to his advantage. It was during this search, a tactical retreat that was anything but cowardly, that he stumbled upon a grim tableau.
