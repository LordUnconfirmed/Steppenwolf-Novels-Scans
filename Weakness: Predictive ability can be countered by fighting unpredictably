The timing was impeccable. As the clone closed the distance, Albino pivoted, turning to face the oncoming threat head-on. With a swift, calculated swing, he brought the metal cane down in a wide arc, the weapon connecting with the clone's head with a resounding impact, his other hand out to keep his balance. The hit was direct, unmitigated by anticipation or evasion, a clear indication that the clone, for all its ability to predict and counter Albino's familiar moves, was ill-prepared for tactics and styles it had not seen him use before.

This revelation sparked a glimmer of tactical insight in Albino's mind. The clone's predictive ability, while formidable, had its limitations. It was keyed to Albino's known repertoire, to the fighting styles and techniques he had previously demonstrated. By introducing elements of unpredictability, by wielding weapons and employing methods outside of his usual patterns, Albino could circumvent the clone's anticipatory defenses, opening new avenues for attack.
