Without hesitation, Albino leaped into action, his movements a blur of efficiency and power. His arm shot out, swiping the electroshock weapon from the lead assailant's grip with a speed so astonishing that the man barely had time to register the loss, let alone react to Albino's presence. The weapon clattered to the ground, rendered useless in the face of Albino's swift intervention.

But Albino didn't stop there. Capitalizing on the momentary confusion his rapid disarmament had caused, he seized the now unarmed man with one hand. The ease with which he lifted the armored figure was a clear demonstration of the serum-enhanced strength coursing through his veins. There was a moment, suspended in time, where the man's feet dangled off the ground, a look of bewildered shock crossing his face just before Albino hurled him aside.

The force behind Albino's throw was nothing short of prodigious. The man became a human projectile, his body hurtling through the air until it collided with a closed iron door. The impact was thunderous, the sound echoing down the hallway as the door was ripped from its hinges by the sheer force of the collision.
