The clone, fueled by a rage that seemed to amplify its already formidable strength, didn't remain trapped for long. With a sound akin to the groaning of stressed metal, it extricated itself from the wall, the steel bending and cracking under the force of its liberation. The clone's anger was palpable, a tangible force that seemed to energize its next move. In a display of sheer power, it grasped the cart Albino had used to pin it and, with a motion that combined both revenge and determination, hurled it back towards Albino with staggering kinetic force. The cart, now a projectile weaponized by the clone's fury, cut through the air with the energy of a speeding car, aimed with lethal intent at Albino.

For any ordinary man, such a blow would have been catastrophic, assuredly fatal, a crushing force capable of going through bon√©, stone and rending flesh. But Albino was far from ordinary. The serum that coursed through his veins, endowing him with abilities far beyond the human norm, allowed him to face the oncoming threat with a confidence born of his enhanced resilience. As the cart neared, he reached out with one palm, his movements precise and controlled. With an ease that belied the force bearing down on him, he caught the cart, diverting its path with a slight maneuver that sent it careening harmlessly to the side.
