Albino's grip tightened, his jaw clenching with barely contained rage. The revelation sent a surge of adrenaline coursing through his veins. His eyes glinted with a mixture of disgust and satisfaction as he watched the cultist's fate unfold. True to his word, the man's punishment wasn't the flames of the altar, but rather a fate far more gruesome and agonizing.

With a merciless grip, Albino seized the cultist's face, his fingers digging into the soft flesh with inhuman strength. Without a word, he leaned in close, his features twisted into a mask of contempt, before unleashing a torrent of acidic spit upon the man's skin.

The cultist's screams echoed through the chamber, a symphony of agony that reverberated off the stone walls. As the acidic saliva made contact with his flesh, it began to eat away at his skin with horrifying speed, dissolving flesh and bone alike in its corrosive embrace.

A sickening sizzle filled the air as the cultist's features were consumed by the acidic onslaught. His eyes melted like wax beneath the searing heat, his screams choked off by the rapid dissolution of his vocal cords. Albino's spit punched through his face like a series of grotesque bullet wounds, leaving behind a nightmarish tableau of disfigurement and death.

With a final, gurgling gasp, the cultist slumped to the ground, his body nothing more than a twisted husk of melting flesh and shattered bone. Albino regarded the grisly scene with a cold detachment, his expression unreadable as he turned away from the charnel carnage.

His abilities had undergone a profound evolution, one that promised to make him even deadlier than before.

The memory of his encounter with the android flashed through his mind, the moment when desperation had driven him to bite into his own lip, mingling his blood with his saliva. It had been a reckless gambit, a desperate ploy to gain the upper hand against his mechanical adversary. But in that moment of desperation, something extraordinary had occurred.

The intermingling of his blood and saliva had triggered a transformation, a mutation that had imbued his bodily fluids with the same corrosive potency as his blood. No longer confined to the confines of his veins, his lethal essence now coursed through every drop of fluid that he produced.
