The man's composure wavered, his confidence faltering under Albino's piercing gaze. "That's none of your damn business," he snapped, his voice tinged with frustration. "Now drop your weapons and put your hands above your head, or I'll shoot."

Albino's smirk widened into a sly grin as he raised his hands in mock surrender. "As you wish," he said smoothly, his eyes glittering with a steely resolve. "But just remember, my friend, I'm not the one you should be worrying about. It's what comes next that should concern you."

As the tension in the room reached its zenith, Albino felt a familiar surge of power coursing through his veins. His blood began to boil, his muscles tensing with newfound strength, and his eyes blazed with an intense crimson hue as he tapped into his 'elevated' state. With the agility of a predator stalking its prey, he turned to face the man behind him, a smirk playing on his lips as he anticipated the coming confrontation.

Before the man could react, he pulled the trigger of his Glock, the sound of the gunshot ringing out in the enclosed space. But Albino was already in motion, his movements lightning-fast as he reached out and snatched the gun from the man's hand with an almost supernatural speed. In one fluid motion, he repositioned the gun to face his adversary, his stance poised and lethal, just as the bullet finally emerged from the gun’s canister and swiftly punched through the soldier’s mid-section.

The man's eyes widened in disbelief as his hands shot out to grasp his wounded abdomen as he took several steps back. With a mocking chuckle, Albino taunted, "Now, why did you have to go and shoot yourself? I told you, Glocks ain't up to par. Should have carried a Deagle..." His voice dripped with scorn as he teased the man, his smirk widening into a feral grin. "Want me to give you one?"
