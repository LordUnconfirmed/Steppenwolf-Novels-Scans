The crowd, oblivious to the subtle dynamics unfolding within the ring, cheered and gasped at the display of martial prowess. But Ivor, locked in this enigmatic confrontation, felt a growing sense of isolation, a realization that this battle was not just about physical supremacy, but about deciphering the intentions and motivations of an opponent who was an enigma wrapped in the guise of a competitor.

With each passing moment, the match became less about scoring points or securing a submission and more about understanding the silent dialogue between them, the exchange of moves and counters that seemed to carry a weight of meaning, a depth of implication that Ivor was only beginning to grasp.

In the midst of their intense exchange, Ivor decided to employ a partial Dim Mak, a move designed to temporarily stun his opponent and shift the momentum of the match. He executed the technique with precision, expecting it to incapacitate Rick Doe momentarily, but the result was startlingly different from what he had anticipated. Rick grunted, a sound more of acknowledgment than of pain, and to Ivor's surprise, he remained largely unaffected by the maneuver.

Seizing on Ivor's momentary confusion, Rick swiftly transitioned into a Heel Hook. The move was executed with a mechanical efficiency that felt out of place in the organic chaos of a martial arts match. The heel hook, so known in the annals of mixed martial arts for its complexity and potential for injury, was a choice that puzzled Ivor. There were simpler, more direct submissions that Rick could have opted for, yet he chose a technique that required a precise setup and a deep understanding of manipulating joints and ligaments.

The technique was not allowed in most tournaments due to the high risk of injury for the performer – Ivor’d half-expected it to be at least called out, and optimally for there to be some kind of external intervention. That there wasn’t any made his mind race with questions. It seemed that, with each passing moment, the entire setup for the tournament became shadier...
